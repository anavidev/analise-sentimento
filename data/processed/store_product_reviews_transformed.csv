ok product;1
half plate and glass is ok but bowls are very very small and quarter plates are little bit thin;1
sound quality is good but i expect too bess;1
alexa is far better;1
awesome product ;1
awesome product love it;1
great;1
good product;1
bluetooth speaker is better than google nest mini because you need 24 hours of electricity and wifi to run it;1
nice i am satisfied;1
awesome bass small speaker with loud music it works with direct ac power if you dont have power backup you need to buy a small ups device for that i am using my old wifi router ups it will bang without stopping;1
awesome product ;1
so i bought a pixel 4a and as an offer got this for just 1 rupee pros 1 google assistant works seamlessly you can set your phone to not respond to your voice when this device is nearby the features that the assistant provides is same as phone however the mics are well placed and can recognize your voice from distance as well 2 build quality and design this is the best build quality you can get in this price bracket it looks far premium than any similarly priced home assistants;1
excellent quality;1
just woo ;1
its great;1
well this is fun my parents at home are enjoying this product by playing songs and stuffshockingly got it for 1 rupee with pixel 4a offer valid till july 2021;1
super;1
good products from google;1
nice product only sound quality need to improve;1
must have a inbuilt battery like a bluetooth speakeronly thing they need to do this;1
good product;1
awesome;1
gifted to my sisterrecommended by my son both loving it ;1
smart and intelligent google efforts towards human centric society love it;1
its awesome;1
very nice ;1
mazza aa gya it helped me a lot to connect all my devices;1
it is a good product when you have all smart devices in your home but never buy it if you dont have any smart devices and it dont have battery;1
best speaker;1
excellent product;1
super product;1
good ahd fast delivery;1
i feel in terms of conversations alexa is more humanlikegoogle assistant makes you feel youre talking to a robot which you actually are but its all about user experience at the end some replies are pretty formalinformation wise google assistant certainty aces information is mostly accurate and authentic but like i said you wont get a friend feeling that alexa provides;1
i love this;1
i got it only just rs499got a authentic and original product from flipkart 499rs and google nest mini 2nd gen amezing;1
i think alexa is better;1
good products in this price rs 1999;1
nice;1
super cool;1
value for money;1
good product had to reset to get connected with wifi price bit high;1
alexa is much better then thiswont recommend;1
not bad;1
wonderful innovations;1
i got it at 1499 in offer it worths this price it can do several ai work from answering your daily questions from playing songs it can even do further with googles routine features;1
the product is very good and well its nice;1
best;1
easy to setup easy to use value for money have to use this plugged to power;1
beautiful sound quality;1
great device im making my room fully automated and this is soo helpful in doing that besides what can even beat google;1
i loved it its very nice but the sound quality is not as expectedand another one is it doesnt have battery if it has a battery backup atleast for 5hours then it will be awesome;1
bass is not as excepted sometimes ok google not listen you;1
go for alexa echo dot if you have not dependent on googles ecosystemi have an echo dot at my home which works way better than this in terms of sound quality and mic sensitivity you have to shout if you want to do something with voice commands when the songs are playing on this this is not the case with echo dot for first timers dnt waste your money on this echo dot is way better for kids and family member to listen to songs and do minor tasks;1
good speaker in budget and really smart as compared to alexa;1
really awesome product thank god;1
really great product;1
its good product;1
good sound quality;1
very useful and addictivegot it for 2k and i feel its all worth it for my usagefor all those who are worried about poor ratings about battery backup know the product before buying itit works only with power and not a portable bluetooth speakerit does it works simply superb detects voice way better than voice assistant in mobile phones daily reminders alarm and other smart devices;1
i have given google n mini poor rating because of lack of rechargeable battery and absence of bluetooth supportit works only when you have very high speed internet connection and conumes very large chunk of data to play even few hours of music i m thinking for return refund the product because it seems too costly for price of 2000 rupees but but but its melodious sound and deep bass has awesome quality stopping me to doing so;1
very hard to pair with google home instead buy mi smart speaker very much user friendly;1
i am posting the review of this product after a year and its pretty awesome product i liked i think you people should buy this product will be also helpful for educational purposes ;1
i bought it at a unbelievable price segment it was 49900 inr before buying it you must buy a new smartphone then go for it nice product;1
just awesome;1
good product with 1600rs;1
sound quality and look is better than alexa it has also more information compared to alexa but alexa sounds like a human and its something like a robot and alexa is better than google when its about ai;1
overall good product;1
great as usual;1
i recently purchased this google smart speaker for kids at my home and after using for a while now i can say that it is very useful thing for kids it helps kids in learning different things and can also be used as a multimedia speaker sound output is also good and clear at last i want to conclude my review by saying that this is the best value for money product;1
awesome;1
well i am using this product with an iphone so i was expecting the i could be able to use apple music directly with google assistant but sadly that support aint available till yet in india maybe soon apart from that this is an amazing product;1
i recently purchased this google nest mini smart speaker from flipkart after using it for a while i can say that it is very useful in day today tasks i bought it for kids at my home and its very useful in learning different things sound quality is also very good its the best gift you can give to your loved ones thanks to flipkart for delivering it on time;1
nice;1
it is marvellous more than what i expected thank you for the amazing delivery of this product;1
as google assistant is far better than alexa but the sound quality should be increased as the bass treble and voice clarity is too good in alexa speaker;1
superb product;1
very nice ;1
value for money;1
great device got it for rupees 499 special offer price perfect music companion thank you flipkart and thank you google;1
awesome ;1
very good product and it will more awesome if it does have the battery feature;1
works good;1
superb product great sound google nest mini is the best item in this category i like it very much buy it;1
nice product from google thanks google;1
good;1
must go for it;1
voice recognition is too bad alexa is better than it;1
when i use first time this fealing is superb;1
as usual no doubt about this little giantsuperb product at a very affordable however the delivery was late;1
product is superb;1
excellent ;1
awesome product;1
its very nice and loud too only thing if google can give option to pair bluetooth separately because once it is disconnected from wifi and not paired already then its very annoying;1
it great as expected;1
more useful if u plan to have other interconnected deviceswall mount option seems to work better for audio reception;1
best mini versionloved it ;1
sometime not connecting wifi otherwise best music best for room freindly people;1
vocals and instrumentals are clear and precise you cant expect bass especially with such a form factor all in all its a nice purchase;1
i love this i have 2 nest great product;1

writing this review after 1 months of uses pros sounds quality is good in this price range design is good and very handy voice recognition is good you can as a bluetooth device or you can stream directly from spotify or youtube music acts like alexa not much differenceyou can control you tv lights and other smart stuffs cons main issue is it should always be plugged in to play songs cant use it as a wireless device voice recognition is kind of lagging in case background no;1

when the volume of the speaker is high or full you have to shout your guts out to control it by your voice not sure whether it is the case with alexa as well rest all is fine;1
awesome;1
good one;1
nice;1
nice product;1
excellent product but be sure about your usage;1
good;1
best purchase if you want a google assistant to take down ur daily reminders nevertheless a gud speaker as well for your daily devotional songsbut do go for youtube premium or els listening to songs will not be that exciting;1
product is good but in day today life it is not going to use i just used for 12 months and now it is use less;1
nice;1

speaker is nice but it doesnt hear sometime when i say ok google dont know how it is not working other than it is perfect device;1

best smart speakrthis speaker better than alexai am using 24 hours very good voice and sound catching seystemi love this product google is the world no 1 sequre app alexa is bad this price rangei love google ;1
very basic not a replacement for bluetooth speakers;1
purchased at rs 499 awesome sound great bass worth at this price;1
cons pros since from last 3 month in my experience there is some bugs and cache build in google assistant that feel like overflow costly dont feel like voice is cover more area need electric and internet connection all time there is no back type battery some pros are a good design product and easily took any where sounds quality is good very good for a room;1
good;1
very good;1
not user friendly i have alexa also and that is far better than this in terms of response;1
nice;1
i have been using the product since 4 months and now the assistant is taking time to respond to queries stated or asked to but product build quality is good and sounds best in class concerned to hardware;1
i hv mi smart speaker and also alexa but the voice quality that provide google mini is very nice you will get 14 days trial of youtube account but after 14 days you are not eligible to command any song that u like too much add on youtube music;1
pretty useful with terrific sound quality the only limitation is that it can connect with only 1 predefined wifi network it would be way better if it can automatically detect the available wifi and connect to it;1
i got it on discount hence bought it product is overall good and if you have subscription then experience can be even better;1
good quality product can be purchased;1
best thing at your bedside table ;1
need additional facilities like battery and bluetooth connection;1
good product;1
nice loot;1
great product easy to setup enough for a 2 bhk flat children enjoys it with google assistant built quality is excellent good sound quality and good bass;1
it is very helpful product also use very less data we can also connect this to our mobile hotspot ;1
because of far field mic technology our voice is easily recognized by google home mini i brought alexa enabled from ultimate ears which doesnt have far field mic technology only drawback i see is no built in battery super response calling feature songs news alarm reminder many more love thisgo for 2nd gen only;1
everything of this device is absolutely greati have to say that the sound which this device produce is so fine and natural;1
super experienceloved it;1

good speaker value for money rs1999;1
using since 3 months very nice product ;1
amazing device working in any language i loved it;1

best assistant from google;1
its just good;1

i really appreciate good work and algorithm made by google easy my day;1
good speaker and mike is responsive ;1
its really good product better than alexa make sure you have smart tv and smart lights before buying then only its useful;1
very good products;1
it looks soo good but it has too many limitations we can carry it everywhere why dont you give us a direct bluetooth connect option for music;1
if it had battery and type c connector it is enough as a speaker;1
thanku flipkart and google;1
simply awesome product just 1 improvement is requiredshould have been wireless while on bluetooth mobile so that could have carried without adapter anywhere;1
best decision ;1
good in budget;1
good;1

value for money;1

product is fine but not of much use;1
smooth voice decent look;1
nice product but you have to purchase youtube premium subscription to play around;1
i am from tamilnadu i need think to update the many languages supported yes i cannot speak with my locality language kundli ine english i am trying to change but cannot change it now sound quality is best and bass is best charging adapter is nokia i think;1
excellent product children will love it addition of more indian languages will help to boost sales;1
no comments simply good as expected;1
no comments simply good as expected;1
it is good and useful only when you have wifi connection otherwise its a waste product for you;1
the bass wasnt good sound quality was good but the bass should be more higher;1
using as a bedroom speaker works well at level 13 volume with default bass and treble setting minimalist looks and great microphone;1
would have been better if it could have supported playing without electricity backup;1
one thing i noticed is the sound quality which is good;1
design and build quality is good but installation is quite difficult better to go with alexa alexa has some extra features than google nest mini;1
good worth for money;1
attach with smart tv nice one enjoy it with just say ok google enjoy with smile;1
overall nice but google should improve it by pushing updates it takes too time to connect and for searching;1
using google products from a very long time and not gonna lie but tbh this speaker is gonna be so much of use if you can make a good use out of it and implement good ideas through itits awesome;1
awesome sound quality best product i lobe love it;1
its really nice;1
nice;1
good;1
efficient product things i need in next version touch volume control which is presented in mi smart speaker rechargeable to use on rooftop and with clock like eco dot;1
good quality;1
might be some shortcomings on sound front but excellent sound for the discounted price it offers;1
nice;1
google is known for its reliable products and this device no different exceptional build quality in such a compact device loved everything about it this device along with the google assistant really makes your lives easier;1
very good product;1
thank you flipkart for fast delivery it got delivered in less than 24 hours;1
verey good spekar;1
good sound quality must have history so that searching for few days ago played will be easy;1
very nice ;1
battery capacity lol it needs constant plugged in fyi there is no inbuilt battery in it sound is good as a speaker bass is somewhat okay voice recognition is perfect bought a smart bulb along with itnow both are connected and nest operates ithappy with the purchase;1
best home speaker with good sound quality;1
up to 80 volume it is good but at 90 to 100 volume it is not that good after listening via bluetooth for 1 to 2 hours it is disconnected automatically this is not expected ;1
awsome;1
best gadget best volume and bass and fast recognition by google assistant;1
its a good speaker but if it work on battery then it should be best;1
overall good in sound qualityonly one thing out of 7 in 10 times it listen with ok google command;1
it doesnt have battery back only dc inputsound quality is awesome;1
very good quality this google assistant try to all;1
glad to get this at 1325 during bbd working perfectly;1

very useful product;1
i lived this and its a real utility which helps and we enjoy with it;1
decent product good for kidsconvenient in use;1
superb speaker but the only drawback is that it doesnt have its own battery;1
quite a handy speaker first setup is quite itchy but once paired it runs smoothly catch the english phrases with utmost accuracy but lags in hindi sound is quality is okay bass not that good but voice clarity is great;1
it is a wonderful innovation and a great technological companion happy with my buy;1
its freaking brilliant controls my tv smitch lights and plug now i find it awkward to use conventional switches for turning lights on off whenever im not in my room ;1
as expected works well;1
good product at this price range;1
no battery requiredvoice recognition attention is good;1
a smart speaker from google it is a fun thing to talk with google assistant and also helpful to manage the smart devices and appliances at your household;1

awesome product;1
dont buy it friends you need youtube music premium subscription to listen your favourite songs you cant speak google to play your favorite songs you have to listen what google want to listen you;1

sometimes it dont listen and it required always internet and no battery but good as a speaker and questions session;1

only concern is it needs a dedicated internet hotspot to work y;1
its really cool and understand hindi;1
owsm;1
excellent;1
very good for home to make and manage smart device smartly sound quality is clear;1
must have at home super easy to operate;1
well it has many uses but the thing you cant yell at it what neighbors thinkthats the only issue i have at this moment and if they can implement on device response without internet it will be useful and i am happy with how it is helping out me with so many things;1
not better than alexa many a times despite beign google this machine doesnt give desired results even for the music which otherwise we can find easy on youtube it doesnt take the command proper and plays something else;1
very nice product;1
excellent sound very accurate;1
i got this product for 700rs im happy with this product;1
nice thing;1
amazing product i would give it 5 start if it wasnt for the encountered a problem glitch but it only happens sometimes;1
good;1
the best speaker;1
needs more improvement on usability to play music set alarms broadcasting and to manage other smart devices is very good but need software updates to add repeated tasks instead of manually adding in routines sound quality is awesome for a small room;1
the technology behind this smart speaker is great it understands you well searches any song answers to your queries play podcasts you can listen to news set reminders it gives you notifications and play sounds for your sleep well it is amazing and does a lot more things sound is really great for the price it connects easily to your chromecast being a google mic was weak when we used in summer due to fan use but in winters there has not been any problem faced with mic;1
nice experience with google nest doing well;1
good product;1
nice performance;1
best;1
must have product for home automation;1
good;1
good one;1
its great to have this device to control smart devices otherwise it is just a costly toy even your phone can do all these if there are no smart devicesmost important thing to disable isolation mode on your router before you kick start the setup else it make you sweat same applies when connecting to access points or extenderscheers;1
i like the product got for 1500rs;1
its really good volume is also good i loved d message broadcast feature;1
the device built is great and the response is also apt it can a so many things great device;1
very good and clear sound only one demerit for not available of battery backup only power given through ac source;1
sound quality awesomeai response awesomelooks wise awesomeas compare to alexa google mini is far better due to accessibility of you tube music we can find any type of musicvideo there;1

good item;1
good product at this range;1
awesome product but you need wifi network 24 hours to use it if you dont have any wifi network then it is only normal bluetooth speaker for you and it requires additional device to connect wifi for example if you want to connect same mobile which is installed google home app then youre unable to do so because it requires wifi network while connecting and google home app requires turn on your mobiles wifi note at same time youre unable to turn on wifi and hotspot;1
mind blowing device;1

very good;1
got it for 1499 in bbd offer useful product overall considering the ease of use with smart appliances cant be used for alarms and reminders as if you miss it then its done better to use smartphones for that purpose also it could have been better if it came with power backup or even a micro usb or usb c charging point now i have to carry a separate charger whenever i travel i know its for home use but shifting cities can be a pain;1
liked this in compare to alexa;1
thanks to flipkart 1499 offer purchase;1
really nice product sound is louder and the base is awesome infact you can increase or decrease basetreble with the help of google home app infact it also connects with bluetooth with ur phone so that u can play the downloaded songs offline loved this product of google ;1

i am very greatful to received the product on timedelivery boy maintain social distancing at the time of delivery it is very easy to use at home no need to que in outside lab and protect infections from publicantigen covid kit very useful to any person any timetest at home and fly;1
excellent product very quick results all 4 of my family found covid negative thank god thank you flipkart and thank you mylab for such an amazing product only issue is mylab coviself app is not available both in google play or in playstore;1
superb no need to go hospital or clinic to check rat moreover it is cheap while done thru any pathology or hidpital last but not least you are safe away from the rush and crowd of the hospital do no chance to bring another covid from there everyone use it those still looking for peace of mind these were for my children again i placed order for my parents packaging strong and intact and delivery man is humble and quick;1
its ideal for those people who had just completed hisher quarantine as well as isolation period basically some financially poor peoples cant afford the charges of covidrtpcr test againthis is the best affordable solution instead of rtpcr charges introduced by mylab coviself covid19 rapid antigen test basically since last 13 to 15 years im directly touching with those types of people mainly rickshaw puller beggar surrounding of us not only that i always tried to helped them as much ;1
very handy and convenient to test instantly for peace of mind was relieved to test negative when i was feeling unwell one morning remember you need to download the mylab coviself app to register the test kit instructions provided in the pack are well laid out ive ordered a couple of more to test household help if and when needed as life slowly becomes normal recommended for ease of use;1
good initiative by flipkart to start selling rat test kit online so that people who can afford paying can do the test at home and the medical infrastructure is not overburdened and people who dont have money to get tested can avail free testing by the government;1
excellent product very easy to handle tested yesterday by own and thank god it was negativethe most critical job in every packaging is to transport the liquid that too taken care by providing separate pouch for prefilled tube excellent workgreat product congratulations to mylab;1
i thought the sampling has to be done by an experienced person individual collection may not be proper to give a correct result we have used with a laboratory person by paying 500 charges to him for one test and it worked very wellthe product is a very nice product dont depend on the mobile app visual observation is sufficient to read the result we have tested both positive and negative it is good;1
today i received the item in nicely packed condition and this kit is very useful for rat test at homeoiday tested one kit and it has given excellent result product is well packed in a pouch with all the requsite test materials thanks to flipkart and mylab;1
very nice useful and important products like this every one purchase and keep for future covid neture;1
very good initiative innovative product well instructed guidelines user friendly app if the results are accurate this will reduce burdens on million financially thanks for the product mylab coviself team ;1
after purchased few days app not available in playstore app downloaded from mylab website which not supported to install with mobile product is ok and delivery supernow app available in play store and working good later updated app availed in the play storethanks;1
results came within minutes and really easy to do very useful and i guess one of the most important item required in this pandemic a must product to be in home;1
super;1
must buy i did both precovid and postcovid test using this when i used it at first it gave me positive report for my father to confirm i went for rtpcr test and rtpcr also gave positiveduring the postcovid period i tried it and it gave negativeonly issue is during the scanning the result from the mylab app;1
perfect;1
my result is positive and this really showed true result;1
i am shocked to see that it was the genuine test it told me the result earlier also i could isolate myself early and it really helped me just go for it if you have any symptoms or wanted to test yourself rating 5 for delivery 5 for the package 5 for the inside contents5 for the flipkart ;1
nice product and very accurate;1
the coviself app need to be updated i had a clear image yet it showed inconclusive report and does not have an option to retake;1
the product and concept is good however the results are not reliable at alli tested this and it gave negative report for all of us however since the symptoms didnt subsidise we went to do a rt pcr test a day later and all of us came out to be positive with a high ct value;1
very good product thanks to flipkart;1
kit is very good;1
its goodi dont know how much trustable is this but its quite good would say;1
must buy for emergency use and i recommend to everyone that in every house minimum 2 kit available 24 x 7;1
nice;1
it is very helpful in emergency ;1
for an emergency i had to test with coviself and the result was negative when patient is admitted to the hospital that night they did rtpcr and result came negative as well that built up my trust on coviself good product;1
good productapp is also good and result shown accurategood kit;1
resulte is good and fast;1
i got two kits so i tried to both the strips on my friend to know whether its result can be trusted or notsurprisingly first strip showed negative report second strip showed positive bewildered with report i immediately quarantined self and my friend and did rtpcr it was negativesummary not upto mark kits;1
easy to use;1
i did my test its negative happy to use this thanks;1
correct working me allready checked positive but the are best;1
pls don buy the buffer solution spilled in both d kits i bought;1
perhaps mylab coviself app is now available in google playstore if you dont get it in playstore download it using google chrome then register see the video in the app many steps are missing in the video and in the instructions even though see the video it will be usefulwashsanitize and dry your hand proceed step by step in the app until the timer comes insert the swab in each nostril as deep as possible roll make the solution as instructed close the cap of tube containi;1
be aware when to use this read and go though a lot youtube video this is not body immune self defence antibody but its antigen premcovid virus identification test pack is good and looks authorized though its apk is not available in playstoreit is having 80 sensitivity probability to detectcan be used for person having cold to rule out any positiveit can have false negative but once positive is positive;1
great products;1
good quality;1
nice product;1
nice that atleast self covid test can be done to clear the doubt;1
wow self test fully satisfied thanks flipkart thank icmr;1
product is good but when scanning qr code on app saying kit not found;1
this is an absolute rip off the app isnt supported on android phones i have tried with 4 different phones and says the app is not supported the worst product i have ever purchased;1
i was having symptoms of covid 19 and since i purchased coviself in advance i tested immediately at home and found positive on the very first day of my symptoms which helped me to isolate myself immediately from my child;1
happy;1
nice;1
super;1
its too valuable;1
good one easy to use can help to have an antigen test at home and in 15 mins;1
i ordered 2 set one of them the liquid inside the prefilled extraction is not there or so less that it soaked by the swab collector so cant able to testanother was perfect;1
very user friendly kit;1

great product for self analysis;1

good enough to record acoustic cant use any overdrive on electric because of the audio bleed be careful using it the first time or else youll go deaf with the loud feedback due to the audio bleed barely any noise isolation from electrical interference so theres always a hiss when the gain is turned even slightly up which affects audio quality;1

my aim was to use this amplifier with my sony mhc vx 701 hifi music systems speakers impedance is 6 ohms in my car which were lying idle it is working perfectly so far and i can use my beloved home speakers in my car now the hybrid dual woofers in my sound boxes produce enough shock waves to rock my scorpio but remember one has to put the low pass filters off while playing home speakers with car amplifier because home speakers are full range speakers dont forget to use proper wirin;1

very good speakers for medium sized cars like cityamazewagonrdzire and many moresony has delivered a very powerful speaker at this pricesound quality is greatbass may be lower but fully fit for medium carsit fits perfectly on my honda amazethanks flipkart;1
awesome product at this price sound is very clear and bass is too good nice product by sony and thanks to flipkart for timely delivery;1
its a good product the bass quality is very good in this price range its perfect for hatchbacksthe only con is that the speakers do not come with their outer caseprotective cover which might get damaged by the luggage when place over it on the parcel tray of a cari finally purchased the protective cover of local 6 inch speaker and then fitted it;1
my self installed in my etios liva carsound is good and packing was very good from flipkart seller overall i am satisfied with my purchase;1
i installed it on my swift 2005 front doorswhen i ordered it there was big billion sale on flipcart so i got it for around 1100rs and 50rs for installationthe product is good but bass quality is not upto the markbass is very low but overall soud quality is decenti also have installed jbl a352 on my back doors and its performance is better then sony;1
in a one word i can describe this is just an awesome product at this prize and its a real sony product the quality of the speakers are amazing and the wiring which you will get it is a copper wiring its just an amazing at this range you wont get in the market;1
the bass is a bit low music is crisp and clear not for the boom boom lovers perfectly fits in rear in my dzire a little work has to be done for fitting in front doors as door speakers come with spacer and cover for water mids and highs are excellent i am planning to add an amplifier lots of variation in company fitted and these speakers its a right choice to go for them;1
work very well in my swift enough sound clarity for a speaker on the go;1
nice pair of speakers very good sound and product quality i put this on back side and planing to buy for front door also due to the sound clarity i cant here the sound from front speakers go for it value for money;1
to all the people buying this product please note that only bass boosted songs are good to hear other songs are not okay to hear please keep this in mind some people dont like this any way it is not so low product also not so great if you have a proper audio setup good player and a subwoofer then it is great otherwise it is just okay some songs are perfect for these speakers some are not so while selecting the songs try to select the boosted one this will make you happy;1
recently i bought it and got it installed on my alto 800 lxi car even though these 2 sony speakers are 6 inch givescthe best clear sond and good bass effect toobetter use only sony music systemto better rich soundall the best;1
quality product with better clarity sound and average bass we fitted the speaker in parcel tray of alto800 we felt a little low bass may be due to this but the sound clarity is good enough there is no speaker grill supplied with and also not available in the market for sony that is the only drawback;1
perfect product i purchased all four speaker for my car and installed my own happy with sound clarity and bass rs 2398 for 4 speakers;1
very good speakers with sony megabass unit sound is satisfactorybass is decent dont think it will give bass like home theaterfitting is fine no adjustment neededoverall very good for base model vehicles;1
sound quality is very good bass is awesomebest option for 6 inch car speakers fits perfectly in suzuki swift 2014 in all 4 doors with wooden spacersbest buy 5 stars;1
best for decent audio setup in car works veryy good with amplifier currently using in new swift with sony 4 channel amplifier and sony 1800watt sub woofervocals are very clear and sweet with decent bass surroundingall depends on good fitting and audio settings ;1
good sound quality you will get the perfect details of higher frequency but it is bit lacking in lows bass is ok ok kind if you are an audiophile i installed in the fiat linea linea has 8 speaker mount so even after installing with spacer rings it fits cut to cut to the holepcd of car is too away from spacer ring even it is hard to get the spacer ring to match fiat linea so did drilling as per spacer ring i bought speaker for 1170 installation charges 600spacer rings 1;1
installed these in my car replacing worldtech speakersheard onceimmediately uninstalled it and installed old speakers back hope you get the bottom line now im planning to pull the magnets out and make a nice key hanger from these speakers innovative though expensive key hanger worth 2k plus quiet a royal feeling go for it if you wish to feel the way i felt royal else sense the bottom line out of the words i texted;1
i fitted in swift 2013 perfect speakers by sony for 1050 perfect sound quality i highly recommended it;1
good sound suitable for new wagnor 2019 clarity of songs good;1
i have purchased this around 1300 rs and i found this is goodsound quality enough one in this price rangeactual size is 65 inch but it will support 60 inch space as well due to availability of multiple holes to fit properly in the door;1
very basic set of speakers jst an okay bass affectno wonders expected at such cheap pricebetter invest atleast 4000 for a pair best options are available even online they dnt even match quality of my outgoing 6 yrs old hertz speakers best to go for it if u jst need sm music and with a regular quality bass effect;1
awesome sound coming from d speakers it was along with twitters i having enjoy this sound clarity in my car amazing product we can purchase dis product without seeing any reviews becoz its sonyi ordered this product in a good offer with 30off thanks to flipcart to screen such products in wonderful offers;1
what good is this speaker without the covers to protect it sony must include them in future other wise its point less to buy;1
very good and clear sweet sound good for those who like soft and medium song sufficient bass happy with the quality but dont expect bass like bass tube ;1
it is good and fine the sound quality is ok well a good product if anyone wants to it go for it;1
nice product satisfied after using 15 days good crystal clear sound nicely fitted inside door with one modification no any issue face till date;1
nice but bass is not too good in hingh volume sufficient for normal music lover;1
pretty good at its pricegreat sound quality make sure you connect it with good equalizer setting in local market same is sold at inr 2200;1
original product with proper packaging and bill i got it installed wont say its outstanding but looking at the price point product is really good ;1
perfect for music lovers clear and a good bass effectworth buying used in safari with alpine base unit and got an awesome output;1
very good packaging and the product is superb would have been better if it was shipped a bit earlier but still thank you flipkart;1
i have fitted it on my maruti ignis rear door panel speaker size for ignis is little small but fitted with 2 screw go for 65 inch speaker if u want to fit in rear or front door of ignisspeaker performance is good with this price;1
no words actuallyi got them for 15k no comparison in that price segmentsony is sony onlyjust a pair is enough for a typical sedan car thats sounds more than enough awesome bassi fitted a pair at back slotsif you fit another pair of speakers at front doors meansyour in a theaterawesome yaaaaarrrrrgo for it without question and you wont disappoint;1
price 1600 speakers will fit in wagon r i ordered 2 pair for all 4 doors clubbed it with blaupunkt ml 110 price 1700 checked the audio quality on aux bass is good and will approxly meet your expectations clearity of sound is also good but one must keep the volume at 85 max you can go for it if you have a small car thats my recommendation;1

tweeters are good but megabass is not reached as expected;1
so got these speakers in 996 to my notice these are made in india and not vietnam some disappoinment over their not yet installed in car will do that in some days when i get free time and then ill edit my review on them giving 3 stars because they are easy to replace with duplicate ones as packing can be removed from opposite side without breaking original sony seal sony india its a request to put seals on both sides of packing thank you;1
4 stars for good soundadequate bassand designelegantly sit on the rear tray of my santroi just reduced one star since i feelsome mesh grill cover could have been given to cover the wonderful speakers ad at times you unintentionally put things at the backand damage the naked speakerso just a simple obsetvationrrst all looks good for now;1

value for money;1
good product for beginners but sometimes sound noise come through this mike anyways its ok;1
super;1
very nice mic good for beginners of youtube and voice cancellation is great i love itu should buy it;1
these are awesome they do exactly what they are intended for and a little better than youd expect works on phone and dslr any 35 mm jack input source wire quality is good sound recorded is crisp and clear works even from a distance of 2 feet price is bang on;1
very very nice products nd superb quality nd awesome voice record clearly voice recorder ;1
super premium quality product at this price and its noise cancellation is marvelous studio quality effect and dubbingbest sounding life and fast delivery value for money thank you flipkartabove the expectations love u flipkart;1
overall good quality the price didnt justify the item but its okay because according to online shopping and free deliverythe cable quality is really awesome i didnt excepted such awesome and strong cable qualityoverall this is good microphone for smartphonesplease dont take any explanation any noise reduction from this microphone afterall it is generic microphone without any pre amplifier or amplifier or any circuit inside itand the most important thing is that the cable length is ;1
for those who are complaining about its noise and buzzing problem read this carefully mic works best when you touch your feets bare to the ground this generally happens when our body capacitance disturbs the mic metal body in technical language it is called as ground loop error either you try to hold the mic away from skin or hold its plastic portion so that it will sound clear and there will be no constant buzzing and noise present while talking the best way to clip it with your collar ;1
the product is not good it is like our normal voice only it does not change our voice other it is nice;1
good for indoor videos but for outdoor like public videos for interviewing is bad noise cancelling isnt working outdoor ya but its good for voice over for youtube video like if you shoot in home its good but if your going to shoot outdoor videos its not good;1
i had received it like 1month ago and it is a fine and affordable product in this price line but its not working directly with phone so before buying it you should buy a sound splitter;1
superb product love it;1
good but not enough;1
the packaging level was superb hproduct was best and useful for the youtubers for their daily videos during lockdown;1

wow this is good i like it i take it and grow all grow;1
the best time to germinate these is september and 1st week of october in case want get better results in up now i am getting flowers in the end of feb as i bought them in november germination is good bt growth is super slow;1
got 40 variety of seedssowed some seeds in seedling tray and some seeds directly into the pot and i noticed that the ones in pot grows fast and healthy than in seedling traythis is the result after 1 and half month;1
seeds are healthy and good condition before sowing the seeds remember few points1 sow in seeds pots or disposal glass but needs to make hole at the bottom2 keep the seeds tray at semi shade areas where sun light comes indirectly dont keep it under the direct sunlight 3 give watering time to time but use spray for watering4 if you want better germination please use cocopeat6050 and vermicompost4050 mix very less amounts of fungicide with the cocopeat and vermico;1
excellent seeds best in the market i hve purchased several seeds but failed now this one is super and good quality after 77 days;1
wonderful just need a good soil cocopeat and some fertilizer i just grew them in random soil still they grow very well in dec i sow them and in feb they started flowering even i was not there to take care they just need some water and sunlight loved it the colours are wonderful very bright looks so good 100 satisfied;1
looks good but honestly say best review after growing this plants 1 packet is open there seeds also missing but all was good condition;1
this is super nice i recived all 40 packets and planted a few of them plants are growing when they will grow fully i will show you the results here if you love gardening this is highly recommend to you you must try this one;1
well this is very good product and as per my experience the seeds are viable upto two months after opening and then the germination rate decreased so its good to sow as soon as u buy and a good soil media is also plays vital role these most of the seeds from the 40 verities are germinate;1
awesome product blindfolded you can trust i have sown calendula crystantamum african marigold dahila and sunflower tallall seeds are germinated under 3daysout of 40 seeds 39 are good sunflower miniature is not good its ok one of the best products you can go for this;1

this is very good;1
ohk to im also new to this but after getting desired result i can guide you so here we go1 fill the container with soil2 add some vermi compost 3 spread the seeds 4 cover the seeds with dry cow dung make sure seeds arent visible anymore 5 spread 23 tablespoon water daily6 we patient7 after sometime baby plants will start showing themselves after that you can increase the water amount little bitnote never ever water too much coz it will destroy your seeds and at t;1

its okay satisfactory packing healthy plants but i think they are of different varieties in picture it is shown as red pulm but by looking at its shape of leaves it is white pulm variety we will know after 1 or 2 years if they stay healthy even if only one plant gets success and gives even one fruit it will be value for money;1

very good quality;1
very very excellent product;1
everything about this product is good except for the height as a layman i will look at the picture to get an idea of the height in the picture where a male and female figure is standing near the product gives an impression that the height reaches the waist but in fact the height is only till the knees maybe the dimensions given are correct but as a layman the picture should give a good idea but its misleading;1
the product was delivered and installed as per the promised dates which was quite impressive the unit is well built and sports a premium look i was worried about the glass doors but theyre sturdy and easy to open and close thanks to the magnetic locks utilitywise an excellent tv unit the pricing couldve been a tad better;1
love this tv unit compact and looks great the unit was delivered and installed in the same day the technician was also good at his work overall the product is really satisfactory and better than pepperfry products;1

im really impressed with the cabinet on time delivery on time assembledit is really very beautifully designed the only thing im worried about is the material used it is like if you change its place again again there is a chance of tear down so better try not to push it much;1
its not the best tv entertainment unit in the market but its not the worse either particularly when its on sale and more so when your budget is tight pros decent wood color which gives a good look to your living room cons cheap wood size height is small 55inch tv fits well and not beyond no possibility of expansion they should have at least added wheels so that it will be easy to move around 95 kilograms of weight is quite heavy by any standards cheers;1
quality is not so good just okand the look wise better thn thickness of matter is not even goodbetter 2 star;1
the product is great but only thing is that you need to protect it from water also no cleaning with even little water of it will damage the product it is delicate and should be kept in safe and dry place and wash with dry cloth;1
excellent product product deliver 4 days before from actual delivery date and also installation done as per my convenience jeeves engineer done excellent job and delivery men also thank you flipkart transportation team jeeves engineer;1
the build quality is strong enough but the biggest set back is the placement of tv it can easily fit 55 tv but the hight of the tv base is like only 15 feet from the ground which is sometimes very annoying if you stand you have to literally look at your knees to watch tv if you are good with that this is a definite recommendation;1

awesome microwave oveni didnt expect of this much size its look like 21inch monitordesktop sizei loved it i didnt cook yet bt i feel like greatand the main thing is dont depend on any demo or installation boy or the man from the samsung companythey are not told us discriptively better to check on youtube;1
product delivered before delivery date even ekart logistics carry the microwave to 2nd floor additionally installation was booked on time by flipkart but also here samsung send the executive before the installation dateexecutive was polite and help us to understand the basic functions of the systemthanks a million to flipkart samsung for your wonderful support and work coordinationsuperb delivery and awesome servicethank you;1
this product is the best and in low budget i got this so im very happy with this and i got this in only 23 days after order after delivery i got free demo tooi recommend you guys buy only this product;1
wowwow simply superb i was expecting a small regular size which i have seen in my office and at my friends house but this is bit bulky and heavy since it need to be support grill woven im happy for iti got this for a best price at 8189 demo also was done on the same daygreat servicethank you flipkart;1
oven is nice it works really good it has many modes to cook quality is excellent price is also affordable 8500rs;1
excellent microwavei got it in big diwali salefor only 8200 excluding 300 supercoinsalthough it is not that user friendly but it worth the price i paid i can use combi mode ie microwave with grill or convectionbut i can not use grill with convection its the only con i would sayoverall satisfied with the purchasepurchased borosil deep bowl from big basket and cooking is now very easy and healthy;1
pros1 the all black oven is an eye charmer in the kitchen2 works perfectly delivers what it promises samsung uncompromisingfyi1 do not confuse the user buttons dial as your phones touch screen it is a dial and finger pressure is required to operate it2 accessories such as crusty plate or barbeque stand do not come with this product but it is totally worth spending some extra bucks for themno cons it is an amazing product just like flipkarts delivery servicehappy;1
oven i liked very much with the function and user friendly menulike my previous there is now skew providedif additional some glass cookware provided with this or charge more then also i recommendinstallation get bit delayed but satisfied with clear instructions;1
have been using it for last few weeks and also took demo for basic functions it is good but dont consider curd making to be a good feature to make 500 gms curd one needs to mix 350 grams curd in milk and for 1 kg curd one needs to mix 750 grams curd so if one can buy 750 grams curd from market he can as well buy 1 kg i use it for reheating food purpose only;1
ive been using this since a week and it works perfectly smooth with the features ive got the demo on time as well as delivery safe ive tried grill feature as well and it turned out to be satisfied enough moreover its worth a buy with the features it makes perfect for me yet i was hoping to get some microwave stuff along with the product but thats ok thank you dealer and flipkart;1
very nice product i bought it for the first time item is neatly packed and delivered the company arranged demo of microwave oven but the technician has not attended flip kart sent a message that demo is not possible except this everything is good;1

plate and bowl missing but mentioned in the product description chasing customer care is pathetic flipkarts trust and service has gone down in recent times nothing wrong with the microwave but accessories mentioned are not being provided this is actually the fault of the flipkarts product manager you can not trust the product description any more;1
good product value for moneyno other company will give 28 liters microwave in this price range;1
great work absolutely fine;1
glass bowl and crusty plate not provided as written on the box contents are different from what was promised;1
i always love samsung for that i purchased this one and i have got what i expected awesome love it;1
today is the third day of this cooking machine at my kitchen i am quite satisfied with its performance my previous micro oven of a different brand made me cry from day one as it entered our household within a year the door inside started rusting and the inner door glass cracked into pieces hope this does not happen with the current machine the service person visited my place and suggested to go for a new one and refused to carry out any repair job then i was compelled to be in touch w;1
product is superb everyone should go for this one;1
good product good service;1
good quality and fast cooking features are excellent but it consumes more power ex on gas it costs rs 10 means but in oven it costs rs 20;1

oven is good working fine i want give 5 star but because of delivery boy behavior 2 star;1
the product is excellent does work perfectly problem with seller was that they didnt provide startup kit as mentioned in the description either they should remove it from the description or should provide it;1
for demo the agent called multiple times and postponed the time and date surprise to see the demo is reflecting now cancelled in site not a good practice for agent side it would be great if flipkart can assign alternative agent for a demo thanks in advance;1

hello lovely people so here is my review after using this oven for 5 months it is quite good and its performance really makes you delighted i grabbed this product on diwali deal of 7500 rupees and its really pocketfriendly product love you flipcart and here is the best thing they provided also demo class so you dont worry about the function they gonna teach you at you home after delivering the product;1
very good product i am writing this review after using it for 3 years no complaints so far heats very well good quality only one suggestion if u just want to reheat ur food just buy a normal microwave oven which comes in very less price like rs 4000 or so this one is multi funtion like grilling reheating ets and costed me rs 8500 but since i purchased i m using it only for reheating and nothing else so think well before purchasing costly multifunction oven;1

its more than a year and the heating elements are still working as a new it is certainly offers useful features for the price paid the reliability is high and had no maintenance ever until now inspite of sudden power outages that happen daily the touchpad is responsive and still functions like new the cooling fan keeps running for long than other brands after the cooking cycle is over and can be very irritating but maybe thats essential to cool the oven worthy brand certainly;1

two reasons for not giving five stars1 the markings on the push button control switches are hardly visible due to the dull white colour making you strain your eyes2 you tend to figit for the correct pressure point it the push button other wise its a good product although its a bit noisy for my likingthe delivery was good and i received the package in good condition;1

this is one of the best budget microwave available in the market and the pricing of the product on the offer period makes it more pocket friendly to the users now there are products that are available at a creeper price to but this is a trusted brand and you can buy the product without thinking much about the after sales tension like repairs and maintenance;1
weve been using this mwo for over a month now almost daily and for every meal it is the perfect heating device for a small family like ours 3 of us we have another much bigger and fancier one in the kitchen with grill convection etc purchased with a lot of enthusiasm but hardly usedthe idea is to keep it near the dining table because all that most of us do with it is heat food just before eating this one does the job perfectly well besides cooking the occasional idli egg p;1
this is a basic but up to the mark microwave by bajaj its 17l but is sufficient for normal usage like heating up food i go one step ahead and prepare ghee as well as cakes in it i am super thrilled with this product moreover delivery was prompt by flipkart and the bajaj customer care people called immediately for a demo of the product for the price above its totally worth it;1

this is our 3rd microwave and so far i think this has been a great value for money buy thanks to big billion sale i bought for just 28k unlike our older godrej this reheats very fast 30 seconds for most liquids and a minute for rice our 15year old sharp microwave was equally good the mechanical control is one of the main reasons why i purchased this our godrejs pcb has been damaged twice i am hoping replacing the mechanical knobs would be cheaper the push button opening mechanism;1
good looking and bulid quality very good like this product thank u flipkart;1
its a perfect microwave for daily use easy to handle and serve the purposeflipkart delivery is also prompt and neat without damaging product;1
the product is awesome and seller is shipping this item very fast as promised awesome service;1

got this product in 3049 from flipkart i am using this from last 3 months now this is very nice product flipkart delivery was fast and they delivered microwave very safely;1
i remember how fussed and busy my mother used to be in childhood baking this cooking that frying this sauting that well this microwave doesnt do all of that for sure but it has definitely taken care of a lot of things for our familys petpuja especially heating and boiling stuff are done in a jiffy no need to worry about foods losing taste without heat just take it out of the fridge and let the oven do its job for some seconds youll have the tasting buds dancing for moregen;1
this is a basic solo oven it serves the purpose obediently build quality is good white powder coated metal body and glass door with plastic frame if you are planning to bake cake or grill tandoor dont buy this it is not made for thatfor its price and build it definitely deserves 5 starsthe crazy people at flipkart shipped it at 12 midnight and delivered within the promised time they rock;1
very gud product m so happy;1
superbbb qualitytotally satisfied thanks flipkart;1
great product quick heating go for it got it first 3k;1
works as advertised as an engineer i love the simplicity of this no expensive and complicated touch panels that have the potential to go wrong it has a simple knob timer that uses a spring much like an egg timer or an old alarm clock that needs to be keyed so as long as the magnetron works this microwave will keep chugging along wonderfully i would rate this much higher than microwaves that are priced thrice as much as this for reliability design;1
this product purchased just 10 days back first time received defect productpower supply was not happeningdid replacement of product and got new product and it working fine nothing to worry its better product with this price;1
good in terms of price i got it for 3k and its good for day to day heating purpose its compact and looks good just one drawback the shutter button is too big and gets stuck some times;1
good product ive been using it for more than 5 months and its working fine apt for a small family;1

if you are taking this product with the intention of saving time then it is absolutely wrong that the rice made by the cooker on fire takes more time than it but in this product makes good rice compare to fire cookerfire cooker takes 15 minuteselectric rice cooker takes 40 minutesnow the decision is in your hands whether you want to save time or gas;1
looks good built quality also fine yet need to check after some usage;1

smell of burning plastic while using the kettle to boil water thought this will be there only for the first few usages but even after 15 days of usage same disgusting smell of burning plastic water bottle has a classy gloss finish but it is not for holding hot water i cant believe how people have given those wonderful reviews below looks like some kind of fraud from flipkart;1

nice and useful kettle for daily use especially for hostellers and for rented roomscan be used for quick heating and boiling waterteascoffees and soupsetccan boil the water in less than 60 secondsonly drawback i found is a very short power cable cord size 6070 cm onlythis could be longer like in other competitors like prestige but overall very good productsthumbs up;1
15l of quantity in such good price is awsmm for students boiling is very quick sad part is outer body also get too hot which makes inconvenience it was three days since purchase and till now i have made tea boil water maggie and soup its very easy to handle if you r good at cookingi love the packaging and delivery was also quick so overall i love the product and rest depend on how long it will work thank you flipkart;1

hello i am very confusing which brand is the best one at finally i decided to buy this pigeon electric kettle after i used nearly 2 week i written this review 1 design is super but the plastic quality is not shiny looks like old material2 its very easy to handle3 wire length is very short if u want to increase then go to electrical shop and change the wire or u can use the extension box4 within 2 mins u can boil the 15 l water5 and totally i am very satisfied with the low ;1
i bought pigeon shiny electric kettle very recent light weight electrical connecting wire is too short better if it is 1 mtr of length good for use in normal electcrical connection plug in socket at kitchen and other place;1
nice product at this price range it works properly and also automatic off system is also is good working steel quality is better at this price overall nice product;1
oct 2018good kettle worth the money boils water fast but its a bit noisy when its boiling the body handle gets heated up a bit but its not that you cant touch ithave been using it everyday from the day it reachedam happy with it also looks goodfeb 2019its been 4 months using the kettle everything is fine but the body of the kettles getting rusted on the edges else it works great;1
pros 1 15 litre2 easy to clean3 auto cut facility4 cheaper than other brands5 good designcons 1 body get warm;1
a nice product and most helpful in home we can use it to heat water instantly and boil milk also finally a useful product for home hostels in rooms etc especially comfortable to take it to anywhere while outing;1
very nice but you have to keep some precautions then only it will last long pros1 makes black tea in exact 5 mins 2 boiled egg in 20 mins 3 maggi in 15 mins 4 can make rice also but havent tried 5 any boiled items you can make where the base liquid is water note do not try to boil milk or any liquid other than waterclean the base with little soap and brush every time when you are done with the item overall very good product if you use it properly;1
this product is really good i am fully satisfied with it i bought this to use hot watr whn i hv cold really it s helpful within seconds it is getting ready thank you so mch flipkart ;1
it is good product work very fast and best in the market;1

awesome product but after 2 months usage it stopped working which was fixed by myself just a minor problem with the wire overall happy with the product;1
good heating but you can sense the smell of black plastic lid in your water the inside of the lid should be metal or better plastic since it is a matter of health please go for a costlier one with metal insides and plastic outsides;1
its a good product;1

aaj subah apun mst chai bnaya this kettle is really good for making tea noodles soup boiling eggs and rice;1
its average i expected more bad thing is it is difficult to wash after use because heating kit is connected with utensils if you not washed carefully and due to this some waters entered maybe short circuit happened rest all is good even in this warm water within minutes to help of cover;1
no doubt the product is superb u can trust milton products blindly;1

excellent product at this price fully automated washing machine one issue i would like to highlight is there is no proper detergent pouring box and detergent remains above the hole hence we need to spread the detergent over the cloth after putting inside while in lg the detergent box is below the water shower due to which detergent gets washed and showered into the drum;1
quality and design more than expectation;1

excellent product thanks to flipkart for this deal ;1
at this price it is very good deal installation was done smoothly by bajaj technician only at free of costso it is must buy product for small family;1
3l instant geyser with hot water coming in just 2 mins good for 12 persons installation was done by bajaj as a part of their offer and we also get an inlet and an outlet pipe of 15 m to avail installation we need to call their tollfree no after product delivery but before that we need to make sure that plumbing and electrical works are complete it costed me more or less the same value as the geyser price for the plumbing and electrical part so be prepared for it;1
very good product within 3 to 4 minutes water will hot installation done by bajaj service free of cost and also with hose pipe after day of booking service engineer was polite and well behaved im happy with this product must buy it if 2 or 3 members family;1
heating is very good and look wise ot is dashing and loking stylish and its shape was cute and it heated water in 2 minutes only best for winters you get a easy and comfortable bath ;1
it gives you only 3l water it is not suitable for bathing but it is useful for kitchen purposes cuz when you bath every time after 3 mins of hot water you have to wait for 5minutes together another 3l water to be heated up so i recommend this 3l geyser is only for kitchen purpose not for bateoom utilize instead of this use 5l or 10l bajaj geysers other wise quality everything is perfect with bajaj ;1
compact geyserworks well didnt want to pay extra for installation so self installedvalves plug and tubes need to be bought separately only wall mount screws are provided in the boxtakes around 35mins for water to get heated and auto cuts off provides around 2l of hot water and half a litre of luke warm water suitable for kitchen use for bathing the heater need to heat for atleast 3 times for adequate water close tapwait for heating open tapordered a v guard heater w;1
nice product work well i give review after 3 months of usage and it is only for small family 46 people;1
1 received product as displayed on flipkart 2 within 3 days product was installed by bajaj authorised person free of cost 3 performance good so far installed one week before 4 worth money5 only concern is that plug is not provided if i knew i would have purchased branded plug before installation i had to buy whatever plug available with service man overall good banana product;1
good product using it for 1 month now dont expect a proper flow for shower or even at tap but open the tap at lesser flow or at a rate of approx 25ltrs bucket size 15mins this rate can vary depending on the temperature and location and you can get a continuous flow of hot water for bathing if you are low on budget or in a rented property this is a good product i dont think family size mattersjust keep in mind this doesnt come with a plug and pipes;1
installation was smooth and free inlet and outlet pipe was free that was good part of bajaj offer as no other brands give only missing thing was 3 pin rest is good water get heated in matter of time thanks;1
product is good but the installation service provider behaviour at the beginning was very poor at the beginning they didnt attended me properly denied for installation if you have old set up geyser installed product is best service wise flipkart installation is not good only purchasing the product is nice flipkart installation service is not good;1
very happy with the product get free installation on 2nd day of product received bajaj service is very good on time delivery from flipkart i recommend this product just go for it;1
always a fan of bajaj products especially geysers since a decade reliable and long lasting;1
i am satisfied with the product i want to share my experience regards to the installation as i was expecting the technician to arrive some one called in my registered number and took my location details reached home and started installation process charged me for the pipes and plug while he was working another person called and addressed himself as technician from bajaj for installationi informed that someone is already doing the job i had a doubt so asked this second man if ther;1
good product;1
good geyser and good working must buy it ;1
great product hot water in just 3 min small and efficient;1
its fabulous working very good thanks flipkart;1
good product but brand and model logo are different;1
small and cute serves the purpose where small amount of water is needed for example in kitchens people buying it for their bathrooms please be aware that its a 3l cylinder so keep your expectations according to that works smoothly and no complaints at all i got the installation done through local plumber only because he was available that day;1
this the very powerful geyser thats the power is bajaj just 1 minute heat the water master blaster thank u flipkart;1
good working and fast also;1

as a product geyser is working fine and wxpected heating within 10 minutes cons being no free installation neither from the company nor flipkart moreover no pipes or angular were provided so buyer needs to buy them and also installation is at your own expense plug was also not there which is unusual so had to buy that as well but read some reviews online and found out actually bajaj doesnt provide accessories neither does it provide top though the wires are there almost another 1500160;1

using it since two weeks performance is an expected like any other ro machine i was using bluestar before this but i wasnt happy with the after sales service also the motor for it had gone bustmy main reason to switch to kent was due the wider availability of spares and availability of a lot of third party service guys additionally i like the feature of having a uv light inside the tank which hopefully means that even the stored water stays pure for longeri live in mumbai and the;1

one thing you have to consider when you buy a home appliance like this is the service the company provides live pure is the best when it comes to quality and service but its also freakishly expensive and goes way out of budget for many of us the next best option in my opinion is kent water purification is great service provided by the company is good the technicians are are well trained like everyone said you will have to keep a 1000 bucks ready when they come for the installation bec;1
prompt service from flipkart and kent got a call from kent on the same day of delivery installation was completed on the same day i am deducting one star only because the prefilter doesn t come included in the package you will have to purchase it from the technician in my case the tds level is around 800 so had to install the prefilter other than that everything is great about the purifier;1

excellent product no doubt best in the market you get so many products in lesser price but they use cheap equipment to reduce the cost so water quality varies when it was tested the tds of tap water reduced from 665 to 57 what a world class product would recommend to go for this;1
since filter cost is high servicing cost more than machine so spending 5k each year on filter is not reasonable so kent shd think bit different from purifier company than providing 3 yr service free please reduce filter cost;1

tds level post purification hovers in the range of 50100 theres some noise during purification but nothing out of place it has ro mineraliser the mineraliser is most probably a gimmick if tds level post purification stays between 50150 youre good to go kindly do not buy water purifiers which reduce the tds levels below 50 tank capacity is good takes 1520 minutes to top the tank water taste is almost at par with bisleri the tap is a bit of nuisance if youre not careful ;1

i was a bit apprehensive about buying this water purifier from livpure primarily because of the comments about the bad experiences with the service team from livpure during the installation but now i can say my apprehensions were completely unnecessary coming to the product as per my understanding of ro purifiers the features after a point are just placeholders i think this ro purifier has all features we require for day to day use looks wise it can be better but its relatively well;1
well made product and have been using it for about 1 year now was surprised to know from the company that the free service during warranty period entitles us to a new cartridge filter every time the service person used to visit and simply knock the mud out of the filter and put it back after informing the company guys they called for extension of the warranty i reported this to them action was promised but nothing happened guess its the outsourcing of service to unscrupulous age;1

livpure is a reputed brand regarding water purifier i love the productworking so nicely but one thing i would i like to share that the installation engineer has taken more money for outer purifier which is available at a reasonable rate in the local market i suggest the company to look into this matter;1
delivery and easy installation was the best part purifier is of good quality build tap provided is quite ergonomic and well designedcons there is no water level indicator and the adaptor provided does not look long lasting even the installation person advised me to switch off the purifier during night time so that adapter can be protected from power surge;1
best purifier available in the market as of now with its taste enhancer youll get a rich test installation was done seamlessly and i requested the guy to adjust tds at 80 which is a good level tank is sufficient for whole day use and purification is very good other brands are just fooling us as with same configuration bigger brands like kent sell it at almost 13k totally satisfied with this dont fall for other big brands this one is perfect;1
its really cool product i have given it 5 star rating specially for the taste of water i paid 7k for it during offer period and its totally worth it the service part was a also good as the installation guy came up the next day on my request the only thing that looks shady is that he charged rs 650 for the external filter and that too without any bill but overall it is a good option for a low cost water purifier;1

delivery guy was really very helpful and did a good job ;1
great system with all necessary features the best part is the after sales service theres an app that you register to and it already has your details unlimited free services for 4 years is amazing aquaguard charges 34 thousand for 2 years for filter with same features some parts give problems sometimes but can be solved by service and there is no indicator on light its too quite to know if its on so gave 4 rating otherwise its a good purchase;1
product is good but they are not giving sediment filter along with the rofr sediment have paid 700 installation charges when service is free thn why ur taking money in the name of free serviceur using uv filteration name with just a light rest is fine water taste is good;1
nice products proper fiting clean water good service thank you for flipkart;1
product is very good after filtering the water taste of water become very good nd more over while drinking water you realise that water become more light which make you drink more water i got my product one day before delivery date nd more installation is done on same day hassle free product was packed properly no doubt i give 55 for flipkart nd 45 to kent as i did little extra fitting which cost me 400 rs extraoverall flipkart h;1
best ro but there was leakage after 2 days of installation but rectification done within 2 hours after complain ace is providing good customer service loving this product from last 2 months go for this one as water after purification is very pure and in great taste;1
i liked the overall productmy suggestion to improve the quality at higher standards would be 1 there should be one light indication power on button and water label indication specially during nights2 taste of water can be improved in terms of normal mineral water taste bit of sweetness goes out in purified watermy water tds presently set at 60;1
i received the product well before time in very good condition as shown in display installation was managed by flipkart itself free of cost they charged me rs950 extra for prefilter proso far working very well always maintains a level of water so that is is readily available in good quantityeasy to usecons high water wastage more than three times 3 star for not mentioning this very high annual maintenance approx 4000;1

review after using 1month over priced installation person is not skilled no knowledge even he doesnt have correct woking tds meter he said tds will be vary upto months so no need to adjust tds control afte installation services man said tds is 95 but i checked with another 2 tds meters both are showing tds 23 only so less tds means no minerals if there is no minerals why we have to buy this for double time more price than standard brands livpure bluestar aquaguardand hi;1
the product is good but there is a major technical misinformation the storage capacity is actually 67ltrs only and its easily visible as it never gets filled completely this information has been hided so as to market the product at a higher cost compared to the counterparts offering same capacity even the service engineer is helpless as the company doesnt provide it with the original water level limit switch rest things fine as a company kent has to get more mature and transparent at ;1
product is working fine kent ace with uv and tds controller please note that you have spend extra 1200 rs for prefilter and 300 rs for ro cover at the time of installation ro cover is optional but prefilter worth rs 1200 is mandatory by kent;1
excellent;1
using for last 15 days no issues set tds 120 units taste is ok using bottled drinking water for last 18 years no difference in taste but unaware about the after sales service and the hidden costs to it will post for the same after few days;1
great service with great support;1
water taste is good;1

super delivery and free installation;1
good experience with kent;1
product good ;1
this product is very good and purification speed is good and nothing more ;1
over all its a good product from kent but still they are manufacturing the purifier with an old style only a white blue colour combination simple designthey can try something different design and colour which will make it more valuable amongst the customer;1
good;1
one of the best water purifier its took 3040 mins to fill up the tank i got this product at 11049 by icici credit card option installer taken 950 rupees for sediment filter i requested to kent for providing the same with the product the tds of water down from 855 ppm to 105 ppm the main demerit is lots of wastage of water;1
nice product installation was very quick and happy with product;1
great deal got this product on discounted price on time delivery and same day installation reducing tds upto 60 and taste of water is good purifiers fastly takes around 20 mins to fill the tank running very silent no extra noise value for me;1
good one purified water tastes good installation was on time tds before and after installing was not checked by the technician as meter wasnt availableuv light available in the water storage compartmentmotor doesnt make much noise;1
excellent productprice worthy;1
at the time of installation kents technician fix the tds level only 16 for that reason i faced some indigestion problem on subsequent date they fixed it 100 level now it is ok flipkart timely delivered the kent filter and kent installed the filter in time;1
good product delivered before time installed in time by kent there was a little problem with overflow but installation guy solved that courier boy was innocent and very pleasant behaviour;1
good product for house use working good and service is very good;1
good;1
the product is nice and i purchased it for around 10000 on big billion sale only drawback was i got to that i have to pay 1200 separately for sediment filter rest the product is fine and water quality is good till now will update later if i notice some changes later;1
nice product completely changed taste of water;1
its good;1
good;1
too good ;1
worth for money;1
value for money;1
good quality product;1
in general product is good and purification is well inlet water tds was 280 and outlet set to 70 taste is good but for 8l of water wastage is around 11litres one major thing missing is the indication lights now a days all products have indication light but strangely kent became more stingy in that it s a very basic thing which any product should have;1
very fast delivery and installation value for money;1
best;1
excellent product timely delivered and timely installed;1
satisfied;1
value for money;1
this product is mandatory in todays lifestyle it fullfills all the required needsit is value for money kent is best when it comes to water purifier they delivered product before time installation process is also smooth you just need to pay for extra 1000 1200 k for extra filter;1
fast delivery nd ultrafast installation;1
review after 2 days installation within 3 hrs of delivery purification is perfect price should be alteast 23k low but i m ok with this total of 4 years of service and at every 3 months;1
nice product;1
overall quality and results of water purifier is goodtaste and smelling changedonly point to b note is they charge me extra 1200 during installation for outer filterwhich nowhere mentioned during purchasevalue for money;1
nice product;1
fulfils expectations;1
good product can improvise a lot on looks and at this price point should have basic indicators good that it has auto cut for no water or tank full water wastage is lot good purification and taste is okay;1
nice product but not able to understand the price range of kent products prices are on higher side;1
writing review after 2 months of usepurification quality is at its best upto 200 ppm can be purified without any problem not using any external filtering outletsbuild quality is 45 just because of transperant plastic bodyin all other aspects its at its best;1
nice product in this range and useful for small family of 4 members;1
good product;1
product is to good;1
great product;1
good taste and will recommend;1
if we get water from this kent ro and keeps one day in bottle it will very bed smell and looks like oily;1
good installation;1
had to pay 1200 for extra filter maintenance cost 4500 per year as per installation guy i mean really i wish i had researched more options before buying3 stars for overpricing and too much gimmick;1
nice taste;1
best purifier available in market value for money;1
nice product if you can afford 3k extra go for ace plus or extra which has a zero water wastage process and better filters than this;1
gud delivery and installationbut sediment filter has separately we have to buy please provide sediment filter along with kent ace;1
1installation process was swift but i didnt know that filter cartridge donot come with the kent ace water purifieri had to spent rs 900 morei even didnt get a penny discount2 water purifier donot have any light inside the deviceso at night it looks dull;1
nice ro water purifier but rs 700 is too much cost for glass frame;1
product is good but the installation person asking extra charge for the spare parts which is more than the mrp;1
water wastage is 1 4 for tds level 765now tds reduced to 70 fair product satisfied;1
it is good;1
good product;1
uv light not visible in that tank in night time alsowe dont know whether uv is working or notkent should give clarity on this;1
very tasty water got this product for 10k only thankyou flipkart ;1
till now no problem foundwaiting for more using condition then review againwidely recommend ;1
sediment filter charged by technician was tooo high cost 1200 just double the market priceother than seems ok too early to comment but seems like good product;1
it requires an external sediment filter which is not part of the product so you will have to pay additional 1500 bucks for that i think it should have been clearly mentioned in the descriptionotherwise the product is nice installation was quick and well done;1
good machine value for money i got it rupees 10173thank you filpkart;1
installatiin is so smooth thanks;1
kent one of the best ro great deal flipcart thanks;1

awesome product highly recommended ;1

good product next day installation;1
best water purifier in this range includes ro yearly service cost around 1800 for replacement the filtersif calculate the water consumption no loss of money its good for our family members please choose the kent water purifier;1
i am giving this review after 7 days of purchasekent purifier is same as shown in image and as described in the description it has water tank of 8 ltr and it takes about half an hour to fill completely it doesnt waste much water for purifying 8 ltr it wastes about 56 ltr the kent professionals were also too good they charged extra 1200 rs for the sediment filter and no charges for installation of the purifier;1

perfect grinderit grinds vary faster than my older ultra wet grinder size is compact and the grinding stones are also small in size so weight also less to carry and clean;1
excellent product powerful yet less noisy helps to finish the job faster than before easy to clean not very heavy to lift and shift;1
excellent grinder grinds faster as claimed by ultra;1
super performance very fast;1
it takes 18 minutes to make rice and another 18 minutes for dal idly;1
good product;1
pros really fast has a timer small footprintcons makes noise runs hot and heats up the batter splashes batter as the rotation is too fast when starting height is nti suitable for all if you are not careful the plug gives a shock when the capacitor discharges so switch off and wait for the beep;1
fast and easy handling;1
good;1

product good but flipkart delivery too late;0
received in good condition and working fine but not sure about the effectiveness bought it with two years extended warranty no idea how it could be utilised availability of spares and service in trivandrum to be found out;0
it seems filtering some of your room dust as you open its cover and have a look at its filter but didnt feel any magic as most said usually i keep my room clean of any dusti bought this as my son finds some allergy problems in our ac fitted bedroomac filters are well cleaned in my experience it failed in controlling odour nd smoke once i closed the window and opearated it for a while system shows aqi reduced from 456 to 50 within an hour and im sure will reduce it further as 13 i;0
i dont notice much difference in breathing filter life sensor is time based not performance based;0
ok;0
this product is two year old manufactured;0
highly erratic reading;0
removes dust and allergensbut wont remove unpleasant odour;0
area covered is 215 sq ft not 672 sq ft as shown in description;0
a little big for todays date but other than that no problems and a complete value for money also its quite silent;0
very difficult to know the accuracy of air quality however looks and air flow is good;0
its ok product i did not feel much change in room airits good to keep in bangalore weather but dont expect much changes;0
working fine but a little noisy;0
buying the product is risky as the support is not found as its sold by flipkart onlythe support in public domain is limitednot found rest looks good in this range with wifi features;0
just started using it for a week difference is there;0
overall decent product it mainly works in turbo mode only;0
too overpricedgo for ac1217;0
abnormal sounds come from motor;0
too much noise at full speed;0
the fan create some time soundwhy i dont knowit like it is loosely fit confusedrest ok;0
the product arrives you ask for a demo philips calls you once or twice you may not be free to answer they cancel your request real quick the best product to buy is one where customer service is good otherwise you will suffer every time you try to contact the company;0
good productbut part easily not available;0
okay;0
just good what more can you expect for this price;0
ok;0
the product seems to be good enough but i suspect that the sensors are not working properly when i tried to know its functionality by creating generating dust manually around it like excess dust in auto mode it was not changing the colour indication accordingly as per the dust content prevailed around it it seems it working at its pre determined program some time at high speed some times slow speed accordingly with respective colour changes and not in realtime basis based on the dust con;0
product seems to be ok at this price;0
filters are coming out;0
sensors are not so goodtake time to change colour;0
bought the same for 4k at this price its worth every penny its not as big as other sir purifier but does the job and is adequate for a normal sized room the only thing worries me is the cost and availability of replacement filters;0
sir why only two filter there must be 3 right and what amount does a filter cost;0
product manual says there are 3 filters but actually it has 2 only after reading the manual many customers will return the product as one primary filter is missing flipkart please contact kent to change the manual;0
my purpose of buying this air purifier was primarily to reduce the air pollution and to minimise the dog odor in the room now coming to the product i bought this device on the first day of its sale it arrived on time and the packaging was awesomethe device build quality the design and the size all were appropriate for my taste and requirement setting up the device took hardly 2 minutes and over the phone 5 more minutes now there are two mode silent and max mode at the time of s;0
at the beginning pm 25 level in my bedroom was 600after using this air purifier for around 45 minutes on turbo mode pm 25 came down to 200flawsweakness1as soon as someone enters the room and you open the door even for 10 seconds pm 25 level again goes up to 400500 from 100 and it takes at least 2530 minutes to again bring it down to 100 or below2noise on turbo mode is very loud and you will not be able to sleep by keeping that mode active3sleep mode has quiet operation but;0
it is an ok product looks good and does take out odour however it is not very effective in sucking floating particles i have a pet cat and this does not suck in the floating hair particles also they say filter will last just 6 months and they are quite expensive;0
not satisfied with the flipkart customer care and but about the product still i am not in a stage to give the review;0
cant connect to app asked refund of money;0
working wellwe can feel the difference;0
i dont see much difference;0
device is not getting connected to mobile app;0
unable to install the app even after multiple resets kept it on full day but still fine room dust particles can be seen using a torch floating in the air;0
i tried many phones to connect to the purifier both apple of and android basedmotorola but it only worked with my friends mi phone i did reset the connection before each try even the share device function didnt work;0
pretty decent not the best in market my review is after using it for more than 7 days;0
causes coughingi read all reviews before buying thiseven though it purifies air quicklyi got secondary allergy from activated carbon filterdid not work for mecaused more allergy;0
got intimenothing much difference observedvery slight changemy house is located beside main roadits really a polluted areaso bought this air purifier in deal for 7kdid not find much difference some what ok for the price i bought its ok;0
up to 39 pm it was clearing;0
its too early to comment on the product its going on well however if used whole night or a long period the lower part green light becomes red i dont know what is the reason;0
average product using for approximately 1 month pmi level comes down below 50 takes at least 2 hrs to reduce pm level from 400 to 90100 levelalso all claims about noise level are false on auto mode generally it runs on high speed and noise level is too much to comfort;0
the purifier works well but the app never gets connected and hence you cant see any results;0
good but not so good for dust allergy;0
product is good but flipkart service is very bad i am deleting my account from flipkart and suggested all my friends to do so;0
looks good but the front cover is just a magnetic one kids can open it and filters havent any lock;0
the auto mode doesnt work well otherwise it is ok;0

spin within sunlight is ok but alignment of ring is not proper for perfume it says 150ml but only a small ring type chipset is inside and after fixing it in car could not smell the aroma from it more over the a cons of the product is the glass ball at centre is loosely placed and when car jerks slightly the ball also bounces and creates a noise;0
only rotate;0
product is good looking and attractive but having some drawback1 when road not good it used to make sound as ball is not fixed2 no fragrance inside cup3 its one ring only no two ring which is without perfume;0

book received without stand which is mentioned on title;0
nowood stand provided;0
no proper explanationsome solution does not match with the questionless questions to practice;0
it takes you to moderate level;0
the quality of book is not that good;0
not so good its like a photocopy of original but if you value variety of questions rather than focusing of quality of pages of book then u should definitely go for it;0
book got little bit damaged on the corners had to tape it up but not a big deal the content is great one thing bothers me is the big adda247 watermark on center of every page its kinda annoying they could have put that on topbottom corners of the book just like in oliveboard other than that everything is pretty good 4 stars from me;0
more questions should be added in each chapter;0
all is okkkk;0

product is good but that was crack by the right side of the wheel quality of the product is good but i didnt accept this kind of negligence from flipkart and cause of this the leakage of water from the bucket;0
the product is good but i think the size is not that much fit i mean the plastic used it seems like after few months of usage it might be replaced so i placed the return of the product if youre looking for a short time purpose you can definitely go with this;0

review after first use i have a tiled floor at my home so i decided to get a flat mop instead of the round one the drying section can be a bit tricky at first but you get the hang of it once you actually use it you have to apply pressure while inserting in the drying section because thats how its gonna dry few problems i faced and would like to highlight upon are 1 the white material attaching the mop handle with the mop head is made up of really cheap quality plastic compared t;0

though 5000 mah battery but dont expect battery backup like redmi mobiles with 4000 mah battery only good thing about this phone is stock android and no bloat ware even screen display good but prone to scratches no gorilla glass protection so be careful;0
it fits perfectly when new but after sometime it just losens a little and now the phone dangles here and there first i thought it is because of the summer season because its too hot in our region but now the temperatures are cool but even then it doesnt fits;0

very light and dont use this bicycle after 80kgs;0
good cycle but improper installation which results in broken paddles;0
nice cycle go for it but installation is waste;0
decent product;0
seat loosens itself;0
not sturdy enough but worth for the money my major complaint would be the assembling manual it was given in a way that it would be nearly impossible to assemble it by ourselves without the technician;0
very stylish and attractive but rim and tyres shown in website slightly confused me;0
cost me 7259 on flipkartgood producteasy to assemblewith air pumpi give it 5 star;0
yo;0
good cycle but tyre and tube poor;0
just sturdy;0
bike is a 5 star but the shop that delivered it will be a 2 star because screws were lose and i had to fix them all myself;0
the bike is awesome but the brake were not of logan insted of that some thing kamros and even the freewheel is not good for off roading;0

all the products are good but brakes failed;0
superb?�?�thank u flipkart butbrake bad contition;0
the proudct is very nice but brakes very bad;0
first and the most important thing is installation needs to be done by our own torch rear cap was missing rjng reflector were damaged these are minor issues overall product is good got it for 5300;0
meet purpose;0
look wise great product was great but breaking facility was pathetic u should work on that part;0
issue not short out till date by machanic;0
smaller than other;0
looking sporty;0
in this wheel was painted after tyres were added hence whenever we apply breaks rim paint scratches and fell off;0
good cycle for the given price range design vise must say it surpassed my expectations but not a good build qualitymajor flaw is with the brakes and the wheel alignment had to spend another rs500 for fixing the wheels and break still the break pads rub against the wheel after applying the breaks once the pedals r not a good quality one;0
very smooth;0
all is best but break problem;0
very nice and worthy product nice packaging and delivery but brakes are always loose and we repair it before all ride brakes are not good but quality of the cycle is very nice?�;0
back tyre was punctured and brake was too tight after adjusting also;0

prosdesigner is eye catcherbuilt quality goodriding gives you feel goodconsimproper gears functioning not a smooth riding when you change gears;0
there is good beauty to be seen but gear is the problemthe climb is difficult to climbthe main road is smooth;0
after using cycle for 2 weeks  noises from disc brakes and gears having large noise from bearing of pedals probably after sale service is doubtful;0
after 2 months experience this basis mtb dont expect high performance cheap quality gear system and suspension below average;0

cooler is big and wide maharaja brand trust y every thing is good about cooler create less noise only thing is that its motor is not powerful even in high speed rest all things are good but yes for one middle size room it is ok;0
it is one of the best air coolers at reasonable price have ever seen but the ventilation of the room is must for proper cooling but the size is quite big it will i hope create a space problem during off seasons the air supply is very good and its one of the essential part of the air cooler with the wool wood pads which helps to make super cooling afterall thank you maharaja company to make such a product in affordable and reasonable price;0
big size mostly like industrial cooler but within this price and my house is big it is perfect no wheels but can buy stand and it works fine if you have close home and less space go for other options;0
very good product water flow must be slow from pump but its okay;0

cooler performance is excellent cooling is at its best when its placed outside the windowi dont know about service but have to see in futurebest buy but old date product is shippedthat should nt be expected from flipkarti got little dissatisfaction still its ok because its working goodfinally the product is good;0
great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j;0
delivery was delayed by two days except this everything is quite finesafely packedair flow is good run silently even on full 3 speedice chamber is pretty good and instantly starts giving cool air after putting ice in itconnecting wire is kind of short lengtha foul smell comes for the first time you put water in itbut it ended within 34 hrsmoving wheels are quite reliablewheel lock works good;0
its been 6 days that i am using this cooler we have 1515 room after buying this cooler what i love is it has strong solid body so dont worry that it get broken easily you can fill water from front and back and give very cool air my room feel like its december in april i have to use extra blanket in night while sleeping it has capacity of 75 litre water which last for 2 days but i love to run cooler on pump for 1 hour it cool the whole room then only air mode and it gives awesome cool;0
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied;0
great job by fk faster delivery awesome product i got brand new air cooler at first i checked its sounds not bad as i read in reviewair delivery is much better one thing to say delivery boy most helpful so guys must go for it but i have doubt is this model same to ozone 55 because i ordered this got ozone 55 according to sailer both r same then why fk shows different model price;0
great product this come with very nice packing by seller not a single crack or scratch in it also its brand new mfg and truly original generally people avoid this type of stuff online but i try also have return policy for any damage so i ordered it and within 3 days they delivered this amazing room cooler now come in price range its little costly but crompton didnt compromise quality major features already you can see in description other than this fan is little noisy and its wit;0
its been 10 days since im using this air cooleronce it is on we can feel cool breeze in 10minbut we feel humidity if we use it for more time which is common with air coolers easy to move and fill water cooler need to be drained often knob is down below near wheelsediting here after 3 months use i used hard water for 3months with frequent draining after 3months pump stopped pumping water and releasing hot air once it is oni opened and cleaned pads pump and water distribution pipes;0
in gurgaon at 45 degree it is working on speed 1 like ac very happy with it finishing is not the best but it really does not matter when it give such cooling;0
cooling is good it depends where you placing cooler dont place the cooler close to window the humidity will be high keep the distance of atlist 89 feet from window and open the window ive already tried the same previously it was close to my window and it felt like more humidity wet body so irritating but now the distance is 9 feet from window and the right side of the cooler is face to window and the cooling is awesome now im decreasing the fan speed at night;0
cooler is excellant giving air upto 15 feet in the room size 1215 feetgood design with no water leaks 3speeds even good cooling at lowest speed and used in summer with 40 deg c noise is morebut bearable honey comb mat is added advantageas per specs it consumes 190 wattsmovement is easy with castor wheels electric chord length is only one meteroverall best cooler in its range recommanded to othersi a rao;0
though the product is very good but the flipkart service is not upto the markfirst they sent me a damaged product with case openno shrink wrapbroken plugmultiple damageseven though there is a replacement policy it took time and my patience to deliver good producti fully recommend to buy this product but not from flipkart;0
i am writing this review after using cooler for a month i would say it is silent enough it cool down your bed room within 1520 mins so you can put it on before going to room as of now i am running it on level on and most of the time i have to switch pump off in mid night as you start feeling cold very effective cooling and run well on inverter excellent build quality you may feel fishy smell for few days but it will go off once you change water;0
excellent cooler i was actually looking for a plastic body beautifull looking air cooler which can replace iron body exhaust fan cooler in my 500 sqr ft hall though no cooler can really replace the exhaust fan cooler but after using it for a week i can say that this cooler is the best among all and have excellent air throw with high cooling with no noise level and nice looks i purchased it after a lot of research and i am happy with the performance only better option is crompton optimu;0
writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air;0
its excellentwill feel some odour for 1 or 2 days due to honeycomb but then the smell will gopls dont forget to have some space behind cooler otherwise humidity will increase i felt the same but when i changed locationit if giving wonderful resultsrequires ac comforters after 2 hourswater tank capacity is good and it will last for more than whole night in continuous usewater level indicator is very clear wheels are good and locking system is also there overall worthy and good;0
wonderful product as expected reduces the room temperature nice air flow intial use will give a stink smell after first five hours everything seems to be normal ice chamber does its job for best results mix some ice while filling the tank cord length is small but manageable flipkart delivered in a week packing was perfect 5 for now will re review after few weeks;0
loved it excellent air thruogh i searched almost 15 days for best cooler finally got good one with reasonable price thanks to flipkart and crompton ;0
very good productreliable product from the brand not disappointed this tym after returning usha air king which was a wasteyou can go for this one for sure good air thrownice cooling ice chamber castor wheel evrythng working just great only one thing which i want to highlt is just the front louver the osclitor is good working perfectly but the front oscltor should hve been better overall great buy go for it;0
excellent air cooling the water will last you easily for two nights n the cooling gets real effective if u place it near a window n yes just make sure you change ur water every week so to keep it clean n free from any smell its size is similar to ur 16 l fridge but much slimer n yeah thats all for now but will update my review soon after quarter year;0
cooler is good but air up done setting is not good but all is ok i am happy you can purchase this cooler very nice product;0
to be very honest with you i was a bit sceptical before buying this product wheather it will be able to live up to my expectationsbut after using this product for the last 5 months it has removed all the doubts i had yes a small shout to you guys over here its not a ac so dont expect it will cool the entire room within half an hour or it will work like a window ac and alli can share some tips which will definitely help you to get decent cooling experience make sure the water f;0
doesnt look that much fancy but rest when it comes to work it super and never water drop from its windows;0
satisfied with this product super air flow amazing built quality height is good cooling is also good its not offering many features but i think its main function as a good cooler its work best for me i review this after 1 month of used;0
well i was confused between hindware and crompton but finally i went with this only as motor king is crompton only air flow is awesomelight weightcoolness is fantasticif you trust on brand you can blindly go with thiswin win situation thank you flipkart for awesome delevery experience as usual;0
i ama truly satisfied with the product it cools the room very well even if the temperature is more than 42 degree celcius i live in a place where the temperature goes more than 40 degree in the mid summer i stay on the top floor but since i am using this cooler i am having no problem due to excessive temperature which i used to face before you just have to place the cooler in the right place with the right and scientific procedure;0
in short it is better than snowcrest 85 which is one of the best air coolers out there crompton machines are less noisy and the air throw is wide and thats where snowcrest gets beaten but on the bright side the latter throws higher volumes of air i personally think that crompton is best for rooms whereas snowcrest from hindware is better suited for bigger halls;0
the best in this price range with excellent air throw sufficient for a hall and adequate cooling adequate ventilation is needed to work properlyworks best when kept near a window and another window should be opened to push humidity outwater lasts for 1 to 2 daysthis cooler can make the difference in hot climate when it brings down the room temperature the new smell goes off in a week a good choice to combat summer heatps thanks flipkart for the brilliant delivery;0
just go for itone of the best model and best cooling efficiency compared to all other companies but place it before the window and enjoy the air conditioning loving iti bought it for 9878 which is an offer priceloved alot enjoying the chilling room;0
i bought this after comparing over 30 different types of coolers its cooling is good but nothing compared to desert coolers like kenstar cyclone 12 what i observed that the cooling pads at the back are not properly soaked in water compared to side cooling pads this maybe the reason why cooling is lesser still its better than most coolers out there in marketprosit looks classy low noisehuge 70l tankpowerful 180 degree airthrowconsno indicator light no single switch to turn o;0
it is worth every single penny i bought this cooler for the indoor room where air ventilation is not much but this cooler performs really well for that room the fan motor is very powerful and the water tank is also has a good capacity it cools the room very well where there is no ventilation if it gets the air ventilation it will perform much better please go for it but keep in mind the service for this cooler is very expensive more than acbecause the honey grass are real expensive;0
design is good but not worth itcooling is ok ok air distribution is also normalwill recommend to go for some local cooler as they deliver more chilled air than this one and are cheaper also;0
wow super cooling delivery date is 27may but excellent and fast flipkart delivered on 24may;0
cooler is very compact and movable look wise greatperformance was good but not excellent as in extreme heat it doesnt cool as otherwise also difficult to clean the tank leading to stink;0
genuine feedback cooler is not so cool but below average it can prevent only the hot air blown by nature during hot climate in summer u can get the air like rainy day nothing else;0
great product by crompton nice cooling nice looks nice wheels go for itonly concern is length of power cord but you can manage this with extension cordboard ;0
excellent i recommend it but you need fill drinking water 25ltrs for 10 hours approximately and using soft water drinking is best to retain the water pump life little bit noisy in fast mode useful for 20 x 11 sqft area;0
cooler is great but its tough to serve the water into it is little difficult if the water resources are less with you but in terms of cooler its great enough for big hall 25x30ft;0
nice cooler cools very quick but i didnt get the manual book packaging was little damaged seller was dhamakadeal;0
cooling is ok but it smells too bad;0
speed and cooling are awesome but noisy gives you ac feeling wish i could get it in low noise its a huge one;0
after doing lot of research i bought this cooler last week air flow is very good cools room easily water lasts for nearly 1 day it smells early but it is bearable and lasts for 2 days only i want a cooler for indoor and it is perfect for it not so bulky as like other coolers you can move it easily even its tank is full so buy it without any hesitation;0
best cooler air delivery high other cooler air delivery v bad but this cooler is best;0
good but after 4 months use the hinges which direct air are falling downand not good air throwmore sound;0
the product i got is opened delivery service is not goodwant to return this product;0
cooling wise its good but when we taking about noise its too noisy the water dropping noise will irritate youalso it comes with only honey comb pad its big disadvantage is the insect will easily inter through holein this price range go for bluestar windus cooler it is coming with hybrid pad;0
this air cooler does not proper cooling than other metal body cooler;0
this cooler is very beautiful and very good air comes from this cooler i compared many good coolers but i liked this cooler very much if you guys are also thinking of getting a new cooler then i would advise you to buy this cooler friends if you are buying this cooler then you do not need to pay installation charge friends installation charge this means just take the cooler out of the box because the company will do everything on its side i would request friends to tell that you do not p;0

quietly is not good;0
product is good does the job and all utensils are coming out clean without any issues but installation team from jeevs is very pathetic;0
only 4 wash programs available;0
minimum running time of the product is 3hrs;0
everything has to be properly washed by water before putting in the dish washer not good for heavily soiled dishwashers just spray water dry they dont scrub utensils but its good and ifb services are very good;0
i am happy with the product only complaint is its maintenance is costly one time usage day for a month would cost approx 7000 as we need change rinse liquid and salt every month i also have complaint on the electricity consumption as it runs approx 40 min to 2 hours based on the prog you select no complaints on its washing ability;0
after a month dishwasher started making lots of noise service person was not able to fix it;0
product is some how good but installation person didnt install it on tap they told company didnt provided him any busher so they didnt installed it successfully so i didnt liked the company reviews so much ;0
it has not been installed till today;0
please goahead fir big size not even good for single family;0
delivery is goodwhere as the ifb demo was not good because of poor technical;0
it doesnt wash indolium vessels properly and the accessories cost is too high;0
product is great installation was extremely slow;0
ok;0
product and installation services are very good i had received some minor damage in the product my suggestion is you should take more precautions in the packing and delivery of the product;0
ok no problem with that;0
service provided by flipkart was good even the product reached before the expected provided time however i am badly unsatisfied with the demo and installation provided by the ifb moreover we fell that the engineer was inexperienced and locked the machine after the demo due to which we had again called him and unlocked itadding to it ifb have forced to buy 2 pipes which cost around 1400 and some other cost for salt and washing powder which means the pipe comes with machine is of no use;0
midea was good product but demo was so bad;0
product is average not as per expetance;0
product is fair as per its cost do not rely on technician for operation and cautions of the of the unit as they have very limited knowledge about the product and its operations follow the user manual for operation and cautions of the unit;0
just good never compare with ifb build quality but dish washing quality is far far better than ifb pathetic demo and installation service hence 4 star rated;0
superb product but pathetic brand and flipkart after sales supoort;0
the product is very good but flipkarts service is the worst;0
wonderful;0
not impressive looks are good but wash non compatible to other dishwashers very poor;0
it doesnt wash indolium vessels properly and the accessories cost is too high;0
not satisfiedits not use for medium bigger platesits not cleaning as expected;0
average machine ;0
though the product is delivered as per the committed time no one from the company has contacted us so far for installation and demo of the same when contacted with flipkart customer service they started saying that installation and demo is not indicated on sellers page for the product and hence we will have to arrange installation from local person we have not yet opened the box and the time for return is also approaching fast expecting a call from seller or flipkart after seeing the f;0
shiner is not working properly after 1 month;0
product is nice till date i am satisfied with 1st wash for half load and quick setting product is silent while on operation i would have given 45 stars for the company and product but for installation i gave low stars and demo was never given we did it ourself;0
not bad;0
1 aluminum vessels are becoming black and while colour powder precipitate2 detergent dispenser getting open during the wash cycle3 installation also done after 2 days that too after several follow ups;0
above average cleaning;0
product is out standing but service is bad ;0
yet to b installed and use;0
product is good no doubt however the installation and more importantly demo is inadequate not up to the mark;0
5 star for the product delivery was on time but after that flipkart forgot to arrange the installation and demo after waiting for 5 days when i asked them about it they arranged for the installation however this time it was for an ac which i had never purchased from them finally i had to book the installation myself directly with voltas so if you dont get a callsms from voltas within 2days of delivery call and book your installation with them directly dont wait for flipkart;0
it ll not wash properly;0
i bought and could not work till time dueto water not fill and spray inside after installation completedi request to ask customercare also;0
machine is absolute worth to buy but not satisfied with th technician who installed he is with zero knowledge instead of salt he poured insecticide;0
all ok but delay in installation;0
it is only 1 days to too early to pass any comment;0
ok;0
ok no problem with that;0
beware of the price listedi bought this dishwasher from flipkart for rs 37990 and then the installation staff charged me rs 7125 for consumables like salt detergent deodorant etcthe machine came with a pipe which does not fit the installation engineer comes with a bill of 580 for the pipethey force you to buy an electrical mcb switch costing 1320 and a stand 1430even though the advertised price is 37990 i ended up paying 45205 for the dishwasherkeep this in mind when buyin;0
product is working normal its noise level is low;0
tap adapter not available with this product my installation still pending still searching for tap adapter;0
not up to the mark;0
its a ok product i have been using it one week it doesnt clean milk pans properly and kadais little bit disappointed;0
it is a very nice washer low noise takes about 15 hrs to wash a full load on eco installed and demo was delayed by 4 days my place is 10 km from city center but contacted flipkart they escalated it and person came the next day we need angle watertap one with threads on it for installation get one before you call the agent;0

small size with balanced sound enough volume excellent packed performance 999 downside no inbuilt battery means no back up;0
not much useful primitive technology;0
overall i am happy with the speaker but the one and only disadvantage with this speaker is you always have to connect this to electricity all the time while using it;0
its good but faced difficulties while doing setup;0
little bit complex to set up with google home appbut once its done then performs very well;0
i dont know about it;0

audio quality is really good but its functionality is limited;0
not working properly within 10 months;0
okk googlee;0

its a beautiful product in all aspects but mic reception seems not that powerful;0
need more distance for connectivity and cable lenght;0
it stop listening some times;0
the sound and bass is good but it doesnt support all app for playing song and there is no built in battery so run on electricity only;0

speak loudly;0
sound is good i want to give command in hindi language sensitivity is very low i have to speak loud for my voice commands to nest minifrom very close i got irritated during first morning alarm during weather forecast and the temperature broadcast the given home place should be announced but the name of the place is taken from google map which address is not my addthis is horrible annoying sensitivity should be high for voice commandsif it will work with all mobiles or speak;0

out of 2 only 1 kit has proper things inside the bag and the other kit was totally wastedlost my money on 1 packet;0
i dont know what is the problem with this kit buffer solution is very less alsmot nothing so not able complete covide test as we have pour two drops of sample really disappointed waste of money i purchased two kits but both are waste of moneytwo weeks back purchased the same coviself kit from apollo pharmacy sufficient buffer solution to pour that drops and i had done my test successfully at that time;0

awesome sound but charging the device take only 1hour 45 minutes via laptop usb 31 typea dont know whether it is 3000mah or notcause it will drain the battery within 3 hours in full volume actually my flip4 last upto 4 hours both have 16 watt only bluetooth connectivity different with some added features in flip4 and the bass is nicer and louder in flip 4 also price will 2k extraactually the low frequency mode or turn the dsp off by pressing the volime and volume button simoutaneousl;0
evening is okay;0

sound and battery back up is good but bluetooth connectivity is not good in my piece so some song sound up and down in bass and rythembass is not so strong but instrument rhythm can hear clearly this is the plus point of this bluetooth speaker;0
battery full charge 2 hours backup only 3 se 4 hours;0
battery back up is too poorbut other features are not too much bad;0
product looks good sound is also good it has issue in batery backup 80 percent battery drained in just 1 hour and 55 minutesin 90100 percent volume and the remaining 20 percent lasted 43 minutes40 percent volume l dont know whether my speaker is defective or it has battery issue but in my case i am felling like cheated so think before buying;0
sound quality is good but low bass even at the high volume also and one thing after full charge it doesnt work after 12 days automatically battery drain outdischarge and you have to charge it againas per my view this seems to be a not so good product at this price range;0

i wrote this review after 4month using this productconnecting via tv fr pin not working properly only working 4 speakers if i connect via bluetooth all speakers working fine;0

out of 4 speaker 1 is not working and in this diwali period i am not able to return it due to i am out of stationi always purchase products from flipkart but this product does not setisfy;0

good product if price is around rs 1000 to 1200value for moneyi had bought this product for rs 1104 bass is decent not such heavy sound is clear at 90 volumevocal are clearbuild quality is good according to the price range does the job ;0
good look and bass on high volumebut bt discount sometimesrgb lights stop working within 1 month of low usagenot recommended;0
overall it is a nice speaker good battery backup and sound quality is nice i am rating 1 star just because one stupid feature on bluetooth mode named power optimization which turns off the bluetooth speaker in 5 minutes if we are not playing any music if you want to use the speaker again you have to switch on the speaker and go for a coffee break for the speaker to pair with mobile frustrated with this uselessstupid feature now i will have to throw this in dust bin in my opinion t;0

its a great speaker but the problem is we all think its better than flip 3 but its not flip 3 has mike and can connect to another smart connect enabled device essential cant be connected with another device and dont have mike to accept calls the speaker is a good one but lacks featuers of flip 3;0
the built quality is great battery backup as of now is good the sound quality is not as the usual jbl speakers its more muffled type it is something like if u cover flip 4 with your palms bass is slightly more but i think other jbl flips are better treble is less and aa we cannot have jbl app we cannot change it and cannot connect to other speakers;0
was ok at the price of 3000;0
built is good but sound quality and bass is not upto the jbl standard;0
i was expecting good bass based on the reviews posted here however the bass is average and overall sound quality is decent for the price paid for it things could have been better;0

bass is good but loudness was not as expected;0
sound is clear but not loud expected loud noise at this price tag from jbl;0

the only reason i bought this speaker is i want something compact for traveling which also has type c port the speaker isnt bad but dont expect amazing quality from this 3w speaker its just okay better than phones speaker;0

giving review after 2 months usage product is good sturdy and good quality but battery back is down you can enjoy it only 3 hrs at full volume if medium sound then it can reach to 5 hrs so buy on ur usage if you need only for training u can go for it but if ur use for out party then not good better go for boat 200 because of higher battery back up and nice level of sound;0
1 sounds quality crisp clear music on 80 volume above that its missing some bits2 battery backup just awesome on 70 volume it lasts for more than 12 hours3 design looks cool i felt it but bulky and heavy as i had stone 260 previously4 connectivity i faced some issues while connecting the device second time also it disconnects if you dont play any song i didnt expected this from boat i want to give 1 star for connectivity but the range is pretty nice so 3 star for conne;0
pure baas no instrument can be heard clearly wont that great for true music loversi suggest if you only love the songs where the bass is only your concern then go for this otherwise choose any other speaker that provides better instrument separation and wider space;0
it is an ok product 10 w bass is very low when compared to boat stone granede 5 w if we play songs in max volumeit will not work even 4 hr;0
speaker is very good in 1299 cons is that it is on very boomi side bass is more thats why i give 3 star;0
stone 350 by boat is one of the economic and premium product its bass is also awesome the only problem about it is at the highest volume i experienced distortion in sound;0
distortion when 80 sound average;0
bass not so gud just ok;0
with mine it produces cracking sound if i play bass songs even at 50 volume which it really irritating me i have to switch off the power and restart then it work fine one thing i liked its battery life overall its good product;0
product is average sound quality is average and bass is comparatively low design is very good and the size is compact the voice when turned on and while the speaker turns off is the worst part overall average but worth the price;0
sound and bass is good battery backup is great the sound cracks a little when in full volume great for indoor playing;0
i was order in offer price so the build quality also decreased i have two with now one is bought with original price so its giving best sound quality and bass experience you can feel the weight difference also;0
build is solid as rock look premium under 1000 not bad at all buttons are good smooth i dont find any problem while pressing themconnectivity is also good i pair it with laptop also range is good too only drawback is that it get disconnected if you didnt play any music for 5 minutes or so even if it paired with the devicesound is good for me loud and crisp bass is balanced some users complaint about noise distortion at full volume but i didnt notice this too in my speaker;0
bass is very lowsound quality is goodvalue for money boat is always know by bass but in this speaker bass is negligible ;0
connectivity and sound is not upto the mark;0
size is slight large bass should be better at this price range its ok;0
sound is good but bass is not good at all;0
its simply greatonly issue is with the bluetooth connectivity but not frequent the best;0
build quality of this speaker is best battery backup is not good bass is lower;0
over all a good product but the bass of the music sometimes feel too loud according to me if you like loud music with extra bass go for it otherwise find something else;0
i dont like its bass but sound clarity is okoverall average product;0
for normal use ordinary sound dont expectt extra ordinary main con micro usb charging;0
sound tuning is just ok this is not an option for bass lovers sound clarity is just ok for this price its an average if u can spend more go for boat 1200;0

okkk;0
not badi like it;0
the mivi soundbar is good in every aspect but i buy it for my old wall mounted led tv and i connect it with the help ro aux cable but the aux cable side of the speaker is crushed by wall because the connection side is very close the wall they should provide scroos for wall mounting and installation boy for the installation over all its good buy if you are using it by aux cable its very frustrating;0
sound quality bass are good very short wire for adaptor to connect dc it is not a rechargeble type or not portable have holes bihind for wall mountable is pros;0
need a hdmi port;0
build quality and sound quality are both goodbut if you keep it connected for a long timeyou will hear noise in the audioyou need to disconnect and connect again to restore the voice to normal hope mivi look after this issue and fix it;0
i expected better sound quality and bass performance is as normal as a tv speaker with no special audio effects;0
sound is good at this range but when you listen to music of long bass like lofi music the bass gives vibration sound which is much irritating but low bass is played very good got it for only rs1904 so its budget friendly and for ones who listens to very low bass apart from this there is no bass increasedecrease button or else reducing the bass would have solved the irritating bass speaker vibration sound;0
the sound is good but the absence of arc spoils every thing which means that you need to correct the audio source every time the power goes out the bass and sound is good for the price;0
not bad average but bass is too good;0
bass control not available and bass in any audio on higher side;0
moderate product;0
okok;0
this is ok product;0
sometimes facing connecting issue other basssound quality is extreme;0

just ok;0
sound are good but if you want to buy for connecting your tv its not for you because there is no bass control sound very loudly due to uncontrol bass remote connection not good if want to buy for only sound track go for it but for tv connection not a good choice go for sound for with bass control;0
battery backup is zero;0
just ok type;0
okay;0
ok;0
bass is very good but audio clearity not so good its just ok ok there is no option to control bass treble;0

leta talk about thr sound because no one is here for anything elsepersonally it has a very crunched sound if you are looking for high end sound its not for themit has a minimal sound due to which you can play on full volume on full clarity on soundbut the catch is it is not loud enough thats all you can expect from 5w speakerthe build is awesome plasticky but it looks amazingbass is ok not so deep but for the amount of money this speaker comes up its good;0
sound is greatbass tooconnectivity it takes time to connectbattery can last for 56 hrs on 70 volumebuild quality is okayish the only problem is its sound is loud only if you connect it with phone if we connect it with laptop means the sound is not that loud even on 100 volume so yeah this is one drawback that i felt earlier i thought my laptop is having some problem but speaker has guys this speaker is good only for smartphones;0
everything is goodbut battery backup is not the same as it is claimed by the company;0

sond quality low bass is to low overall not bad not good same price zebrranics better;0
speaker distribution is very good but dont go for 45w because overall bass and music effect is very low you will not feel the theatrical effect in this model its sound like some low variant 21 speaker so please go to higher watts speaker like 90w or 120w even you have small room;0

an average product which gives a decent output dont expect above average as i also have a intex 41 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output but this product is just like a speaker boxif u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for itif u want a home theater effect dont go for itwhile taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount;0
ok not up to the mark sound is too low;0
i received side speaker only two not sufficient;0
everything is okay except the bluetooth bluetooth gets disconnected very frequently buy it if you are comfortable to use aux cable only otherwise it is a good soundbar;0
i have owned jbl flip series and tribit budget series even some boat and infinity ones too comparing these with this centrestage soundbar cum all in one bluetooth speaker i have experienced good sound quality while watching content and listening to music but the battery backup and build is big let down the fm reception is joke or ill say its not available the charging time is way to high and input is 1amp micro usb that too in 2022 the product is from nagpur or nasik i dont recall ;0
sound best but bass is low;0
rgb lites battry drain fast;0

this is best for hearing songs and videos but its not good for hearing mic volumes eg whatsapp audio zoom meeting class and calling audio etc when we use my volume we can only hear ear less sound than sound of our mobile phone its better for or video and songs not better for mic volume;0
just ok product noting more nothing less expected much better sound quality from boat volume is kinda low and average even when the volume is higher couldve been much better if theyd fixed the sound quality connectivity is 1010 battery is below average it drains very quickly wish it had 1000 mah at least overall its a decent product thats it;0

good air delivery this is its pro and con because of heavy air delivery you cannot use this as fan otherwise this is very good if you live in hot dessert area do not buy if you are from humid coastal area it is not effective by a powerful fan instead;0
writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air;0
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room;0
pros the best cooling out there with 75l liter capacity and plastic used is also really good cons plugg in cable length is not even half meter and huge noise which will not allow you to sleep so what is the point it is like giving you an ak47 without bullet you have a wonderful gun but you cannot use it for the purpose you got it for;0
design is good but not worth itcooling is ok ok air distribution is also normalwill recommend to go for some local cooler as they deliver more chilled air than this one and are cheaper also;0
please mention the cooling area in sqft what is the cooling capacity capable area;0
ok but not best;0
nice cooler but cooling average;0
it is comfortable for a single person and it consume 75 litres of water for 18 hours and noisy one very good service from filpkart you should not compare with ac and it is better than fan;0
cooling is good suitable for single air throw is not good it is upto single bed;0
average product not like as per comment share by people;0
its ok not excellent i think hindware cooler best;0
its an ok product it becomes ineffective if temp is above 36 infact it increases humidity in room which feels like more heat and uncomfort i should have gone for ac by doing more investment;0
product was good but delivery man was very roud he had left the product down stairs;0
the cooler is good as the body is concerned but the cooler doesnt give full cooling effect;0
nothing problem with the product but there is some problem in delivering process;0
i live in a place where the temperature is 3840 degree in summer and humidity is very high in this region this cooler is not sufficient for these weather conditions it does serve its purpose but not for hot weathersummer conditions where your local temperature crosses 40 degree c;0
product ok difficult in cleaning;0
okay;0
average;0
normal;0
the cooler works very well it has good water storage capacity and can work for the whole night when filled once but two of its wheels are depressed a little which i noticed after a few days of installation i find it really difficult move the cooler from one place to the other;0
average;0
cooler is good but there is no option to take out water;0
does not cools as mentionedbetter to buy a local metal body cooler;0
not reached expectationsbut overall it was a good product to buy;0
ok expected highly but not that much it is fan ok swing updown are not good thank you;0
good product but doesnt cools as expected;0
good one but need to be improved;0
coller ok but upper swing down swing option no;0
ok but not value for money;0
reached expectation and one thing is to improve is auto drain and adjustable air blendsnot to feel like branded one;0
everything is awesome but i am not satisfie with caster wheel which are not working well other than this cooler is awesome everything is fine;0
its good cooling is fine some parts of the cooler is made of cheap plastic biggest disadvantage is the sound even at lowest speed sound is quite high ;0
works well but the finishing is pathetic;0
just ok;0
normal air cooler shouldnt expect very much;0
cooling slow;0
verynice;0
good product but delivery experience very bad;0
good and decent air cooler in this price range bt in market the rate is much lower than flipcart and also negotiable and last word build quality may be better in this price tag like buttons are not up to the mark overall ok;0
cools pretty well too noisy;0
flipkart costumer care response is very bed and not responding and also given commentmen is not resolving timely and giving late delivery but the product of crompton air cooler is great and nice cooling withing 1 hour;0
1st of all the product had a tilted wheel which made it unstable on the floor i changed the wheel by myself the fan is noisy but manageable improvement in build quality is needed overall 9200 its a decent cooler;0
peasant air cooler but cheaper body quality;0
so much light weight fiber of cooler looks very light but quality inside which will find out after 5 years as on today not so much assured with body life looks nice n voice average;0
side honeycomb doesnt get all wet;0

the horizontal vent doesnt have enough support rest all good;0
product is okay cleaning its honeycomb is very difficult;0
honey comb pad not proper wet cooling is good;0
average product cleanliness is a big trouble air through is not upto the mark louvers are not properly set they slide downward automatically;0
the product is okay it is working fine but if there is too much of humdity then these coolers will not work;0
cooling and all is good but the louvers point downwords i had to manually adjust the louvers every 1 minute and then i did some jugad and now they are sort of stable but still louvers should be adjustable;0
just okay;0
ok;0
its ok cooler if put ice it cools good but it needs proper ventilation and think fan dont move that fast it can be better but it dont make noise plastic is not too bad not too good its ok cooling is decent but not worth money if its price is 7000 8000 than it is ok but it is not worth its price;0
delivery was on time and the delivery men were quite responsible and helping guysbut as far as functioning is concerned its just ok kind of product;0
what could have been an excellent buyturned out to be an average review1 cooling is ok 2 technical specs and sturdinessonly time will tellbut i am not worried since i bought extended warranty 3 the direction louvers do not hold up and always point to the feetthe best cool airdoesnt reach you4 ice box is a jokeat best a gimmick5 the fan speed is too fasta simple continuous speed reducerlike a fan pregulator instead of a 3 speed knob would have made the prod;0
cooling not at high level low cooling but other wise over all good;0
its okay product too noisy and its producing high humidityneed ventilation if we keep at window then it works otherwise room will be occupied by humidity;0
design is perfect but have quality issue 1 honeycomb not completely dip in water due to cheap machenizem2 front airblade is very light and blowing with air cant set air throw perfectly only after 2 feet air lost from target3 after use water cleaning is a challenge cant clean properly4 price is double from actual cost;0

okay;0
good but need to improve delivery;0
the cooler works fine however do note that draining water is a challenge as it has no outlet as the summer is on its last leg people in northern part of the country will be thinking of cleaning the cooler this is a challenge as one will have to open the back completely and scoop out the water manually;0
avrg;0
goodcost is high;0
product is amazing however the customer service experience i had during delivery is pathetic and nothing done by customer service to resolve the issue either so quality 5 and customer service 2;0
product is good but too much costly from another places;0

all is good but fiber setting as ice box water input box not good;0
good productbut air is smellin starting;0
not bad;0
suitable for large room noise is little bit high did the air coolant job well few times the fan has not working and only the water pump is working the customer service representative told that this could be due to voltage issue this i am not sure hard to move this from one room to another room the quality of the wheel is not good;0
itsoknot bad;0
just ok not good;0
cooler is little bit noisy but cooling is good using since 2 months now water support is awesome;0

the cooler is a average product it only throws air upto 14 ft maax and not 45 ft as mentioned;0
very cool but more than cool it has more sound;0

cooling is good but more water consumptionand also electricity consumption also more;0

air cooler product is awesome cooling is superb but little noise flipkart delivery is very poor and delayed;0
nice product and nice cool air flow but water consumption is much more than expected ;0
average cooler plus point metallic exhaust fan two water filling options manually or by means of direct connection through pipe ice chamber wheels are good providing movement and stability airthrow is good upto 20 ft approx electricity consumption is fair noise level is not irritating even at highest speed three speed options and three operating options for controlling swing and water flow water capacity is goodminus point the main task of cooling is average small cord lengt;0
good but not desert level;0
the cooler is good in all aspects other than the use of cardboard mesh on side panels the cardboard starts throwing its smell in entire house after getting drenched we have to use some kind of fragrance to stop our house from being full of stinking smell else all good has strong fan does cooling efficiently;0
the quality is good but the power of air is decent;0
ok ok product;0
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied;0
good air delivery this is its pro and con because of heavy air delivery you cannot use this as fan otherwise this is very good if you live in hot dessert area do not buy if you are from humid coastal area it is not effective by a powerful fan instead;0
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room;0
design is good but not worth itcooling is ok ok air distribution is also normalwill recommend to go for some local cooler as they deliver more chilled air than this one and are cheaper also;0
cooling is ok but it smells too bad;0
please mention the cooling area in sqft what is the cooling capacity capable area;0
got the order in good time i could have rated 5 star if i didnt received minor damaged piece product plastic also ok ok and finishing is not at all crompton levelnoise is high unbearable odour on first run that can be overcome i think will update if anything noticed;0
ok but not best;0
nice cooler but cooling average;0
smell is coming from honeycomb pads;0
cooling is good suitable for single air throw is not good it is upto single bed;0
average product not like as per comment share by people;0
it is not bad decent cooling but not that much and air flow is very low ice chamber is a gimmick pump system is old water flows through pipes to the pad and the other way of cooling you check on crompton optimus model crompton optimus way of cooling is far better i recommend crompton optimus over this cooler if you can you should spend 23 k more on crompton optimus;0
its ok not excellent i think hindware cooler best;0
its an ok product it becomes ineffective if temp is above 36 infact it increases humidity in room which feels like more heat and uncomfort i should have gone for ac by doing more investment;0
product was good but delivery man was very roud he had left the product down stairs;0
the products cooling is very good but if you see the build quality its not what you expect from brand like crompton the wheel lock was broken the honeybee cover and screws are like some cheap chinese products i am happy with the product but i expected far more;0
the cooler is good as the body is concerned but the cooler doesnt give full cooling effect;0
nothing problem with the product but there is some problem in delivering process;0

after using it for more than a month i can say the cooler cooling is superb but the material used is cheap plastic not that strong but the wheels are very good quality;0
okay;0
water vents dont work properly;0
not so bad;0
average cooler;0
cooling power is not upto the markcompared with its quality it is over priced;0
avg cooling and air flow also very less more time taken to cool the room;0
average;0
dust catchy;0
cooling is good foul smell for one day water tank is huge up and down swing is manual which is tedious only drawback i found its noisy but okk as it is desert cooler;0
review after 1 month usage air flow is good but ice usage is recommended to have amazing sleepcons built quality is cheap not expected from crompton specially in this price range;0
good for the family but the built quality is not upto the mark;0
just ok;0
average product should be priced 7000;0
1 wire length is very small2 air throw is nearly 14 ft only in the specification it is given that air flow is 45 ft;0
ffggp;0
material of body is just ok its not up to the standard but cooling is good and fan speed is also good;0
product is good but product quality very law its not good;0
delivery is so fastthanks flipkart;0
too much noise other features are good;0
cooling efficiency is very good even for a 16ft x 12 ft room some issue with water distribution by pump on all three sides had to open back panel and manually make some adjustments so that water is distributed on all three sides from where air comes inside cooler;0
ok but high amount and not extra colling in one hall;0
good air flow but body material is rusty also air panel blades are goes down during fast fan;0
its ok;0
cooling is not as expected88 l is way above my expectationsproduct quality 35 5rate 355cooling 2 5delivered quickly within two daysthank u flipkart;0
cooling is best but 2 star deducted because little bit noisy and for smell after first time use;0

4 way cooling is not working properly;0
plug wire so short problematic;0
3 star because of finishingthe finishing is patheticthe product is noisy also but speed is satisfactory;0
the quality is sub standard i expected more;0
honeycomb quality is not goodbulid quality is not too goddgood for a medium size room;0
too large for home noise is also loud;0
dont expect it to be less noisy then any other cooler i would its okay for a small room and cooling is also fine but not too much;0
good but the wheels r very weak to withstand the load with filled tank or above 50overpriced;0
more nice no cooling;0
its ok;0
its ok but there is sound in compare of other brand;0
it is good in cooling and easily movable and working nicely but the buttons on the cooler are old in model;0
look is good but quality does not match with rates;0
cooler pump is not working properly;0
color different good fictional;0
its ok cooling is normalin high temperature dont work wire length is short cross ventilation is must all over its ok in this price 8000 colour is good;0
cooler is good delivery is too late;0
overall good but its honeycomb pads not wet properly that affect cooling;0
avg cooling very less as compare to metal iron coolers;0
averagenot so badnot so good;0
design is good but body fitting not perfect and the front wheel cover which is shown in photo is not on actual its only in photoalso not control humidityrest is good;0

medium cooling and over heat;0
cooler was awesomebut delivery is too late;0
cooler not cooling as expected than the local cooler;0
pl do not take this as a substitute to air conditioner;0
ok;0
working good well packed but very noisy;0
nice product but some cooling issue;0
sound is to heavy;0
looking good but noise is high;0
ok;0
okay;0
good but need to improve delivery;0
the cooler works fine however do note that draining water is a challenge as it has no outlet as the summer is on its last leg people in northern part of the country will be thinking of cleaning the cooler this is a challenge as one will have to open the back completely and scoop out the water manually;0
avrg;0
goodcost is high;0
product is amazing however the customer service experience i had during delivery is pathetic and nothing done by customer service to resolve the issue either so quality 5 and customer service 2;0
product is good but too much costly from another places;0
its okay;0
all is good but fiber setting as ice box water input box not good;0
quality of plastic is not up to mark;0
good productbut air is smellin starting;0
not bad;0
its good not best cooling water very fast dry;0
itsoknot bad;0
just ok not good;0
fan speed is not goodexpected morenot so coolaverage product;0
its okk;0
the cooler is a average product it only throws air upto 14 ft maax and not 45 ft as mentioned;0
very cool but more than cool it has more sound;0
bit damaged looks like used one but cooler it self is very good;0
cooling is good but more water consumptionand also electricity consumption also more;0
product was delivered within two days and is as such shown in the image bad smell is coming i has being using from 3 days but smell was not ceased this is only thingcooling was good;0
nice work ok i think it would have been trying to find it;0
cooling n all ok but we had a problem with swing mode it wont work for long time;0
not much cool it working fine;0
bigger in size more noise cooling is moderate;0
nice cooler ok for now plastic quality not good cleaning not easy sound also higher side;0
good for room of 250 sqft not recommend to use for large hallover all nice cooler;0
its so so was expecting more cooling;0
nice product and nice cool air flow but water consumption is much more than expected ;0
average cooler plus point metallic exhaust fan two water filling options manually or by means of direct connection through pipe ice chamber wheels are good providing movement and stability airthrow is good upto 20 ft approx electricity consumption is fair noise level is not irritating even at highest speed three speed options and three operating options for controlling swing and water flow water capacity is goodminus point the main task of cooling is average small cord lengt;0
cooling is not as per expectations;0
good but not desert level;0
the cooler is good in all aspects other than the use of cardboard mesh on side panels the cardboard starts throwing its smell in entire house after getting drenched we have to use some kind of fragrance to stop our house from being full of stinking smell else all good has strong fan does cooling efficiently;0
really its a desert cooler and cherry on the top i will recommend those who have larger room or more spaces they can use this cooler as there a low budget ac the disadvantage of this thing is air flow is too much for smaller room i will recommend who has big office room we can use for small home it is too much because everything like curtain and etc can be flown by the air pressure of the floor of the cooler;0
good cooler capable of cooling the room quickly only issue i have faced is the rate at which it consumes water it takes only 67 hours to empty a full tank speed is too good even low speed is sufficient for 1414 feet room however the body looks cheap and not sturdy enough overall its a good purchase;0
not that much effective in delhi hot temprature good for single person to keep it in front and feel the air;0
1not effective cooling 2like a fan only 3air through is high speed fan4put ice cubes cooling water also its not a cooler its like a high speed fan only 5 product is simply super not cooling6 delivery also very good;0
good air cooler but maintaining it is pain in the a if you are in a place like chennai then please dont buy air coolers i am not saying this because of the temperature in chennai but because of the hard water in chennai the water stains in this air cooler tank cannot be cleaned easily you literally have to clean it every week for it be clean there is no easy way to clean than tank and other parts of this cooler there are lot of screws in the path of water almost all the screw in my cool;0
its an honest review after 1 month of usage build quality is good less noise air throw is awesome but the air is not much humid and cool i tried with cold water and ice but even that didnt gave me cool air not recommended for delhi summers;0
writing this note after using the cooler half a month as expected the cooling is truly nice and build quality of the cooler is also good except the wheels when the tank will be filled with water then the wheels are automatically coming out while moving the cooler which is the worst part of it it would be great if hindware take it is as an issue and make the necessary changes its very difficult for a person to move the cooler without the wheelshuge portability problem for this especia;0
ok ok u can feel good air flow till 10ft not 55 as mentioned cooling depends on where u living for delhi it just serve ur need not desire if possible keep it outside inside it is same as other indore coolers dont expect miracle as some of review says so rest everything is fine be it design water retention or ice chamber;0
dear company and filpkart users the overall cooler is good but there is only one issue the water after upcoming on the top head of the cooler not spread right and left side of the cooler some portion on both sides not wet properly please check and resolve the issuei have done proper test and set the cooling on high mode this will help the pump to inject high water pressure on the top but problem not resolved review updated after one monththanks;0
average but price is little bit high for cooler very difficult to clean this cooler and its not simple process to fit the cooler once its cleaned;0
cooler is good but drain system is not good;0
auto drain knob thread is getting free within 1 month otherwise all good;0
product is awesomebut delivered after daysthat is why 3 starbest cooleri campare symphony and this 1its better;0

cooler is good but honeycomb pad quality is not good they use local honeycomb pads cooler is good for small room not for big room;0
ok;0
feel cool only in front of cooler to much humidity it createsprefer wood wool instead of honeycomb;0
positives cooler is good cooling capacity is better or can say best for 2 person in a 1212 room low sound consumes less electricity 105w onlynegatives continuous water leakage from both sides worst internal finishing single motor pipe once an issue you shall not be able to get the same repaired;0

was ok but not sufficient for 3 to 4 people its ok only for 1 person;0
happy with product little bit size issue and noisy good looks and light weight easy to move;0
good product but not fully satisfied with colling performance it is airy and blow good amount of air but cooling is lessperfect for small roomgood amount of air deliveryless cooling impact it is like a fan if motor is faster speed;0

it is a small one which can be used for one or two persons only seems these coolers usually used by shopkeepersso better not suggested for domestic purpose;0
its ok;0

it is matter of cost rest everything ok for moderate use and for easy movementcost rs 5000 is justified than rs 6300;0

nice product but wheels not came soo disappointed;0
its very delicated plastic body n coaster wheels seems like it will break the plastic while we handling it could be better if they provide better plastic body coaster wheels one more thing is water pumping is heavy that means sometimes it will throw water along with air bcoz the holes has bigger than normal thats why water consumption is heavy but fan speed moter pump will be working fine;0
neither the pads nor the plastic body is of good quality however fan gives good cool air even in big room;0
everything is good except noise too heavy;0
it is too noice air flow is super;0
plastic quality avrejdelivery is very let;0
everything is good except fan noise;0

its price is high according to quality;0

first of country of origin isnt india as in description the is just a mass chinese product with a custom brand label strapped on nothing wrong with that but the product description is misleading and also the price is high considering thatusability wise yes its foldable but the tyre size and frame size makes it less practical to carry on the boot of a car unless you have a pickup or a van so folding is only good if you dont have space to keep it at homeso considering all that i;0
the front tire wobbles while riding this i got the alignment done by a professional still the problem didnt go away on person said that its probably due to storage for a long time because of which the tires have become distorted he said it would go away on its own if i drive it regularlyother than that the brakes arent very grippy and the gears are not very goodalso the seat it totally uncomfortable so you will need to buy a gel cover or another seat the only reason why im co;0

product is good but little costly;0
pros 1 very light weight 2 smooth to ride 3 installation was done way before the committed datecons 1 tyres are a bit on the slimmer which make it look less aesthetically pleasing 2 seat is also not comfortable for long rides overall its worth only if you get it for 5000 or less else go for a bit higher model with better tyres and seat comfort35 stars;0
it has a sleek modern look and its really comfortable to ride dietician meena provided me with an excellent diet plan and cardio trainer bhavnas session are simply awesome;0
average product but at this price seems to be a good deal;0

totally genuine product used to mke cake;0
mfd date was not too old tastes nice;0
its real cocoa powder;0
excellent product ;0
very small to look like in real;0
not as good as cadbury hot chocolate but not bad either;0
its ok;0
it is good but not mix properly;0
average;0
okk;0
it has cholesterol;0
cocoa powders quality is best in comparison to other brands cocoa powder but why flipkart selling 2 pack cocoa powder together how can anyone use both pack before expire date;0
okay ;0
dont like taste much packing is beautiful;0
it was okay okay;0

its really good water based food colourit has no added flavour and it doesnt change the taste of food but needed little bit more product otherwise in this price its worth buy ;0
light colours;0
extreme watery in consistency be careful it can change the taste of your cake;0
its an okay product because we have to add more and more drops to get a good colour;0
dont think buy this ballthis is best in the marketit also has a inflating niddle but delivery was very delayed ;0
its ok;0
i like this product but the skin is damaged;0
nice but hard;0
darun;0
wowww;0
very thin2nd day of purchase punctured and fuss;0
it has punchered;0
this ball is very bouncing;0
widest product;0
just ;0
exlent;0
supprb;0
standard;0
nice and fast deliverybut the ball is rubber coated so its makes grip on rough groundsand makes a mice like sound and its more bounce and sometimes sound like plastic ball and sometimes it sounds like a steel;0
i love this football its nice and easy to handle i got a handpumpcosco handpumpwith this ball but its not worthy enough the handpump get broken easily but the ball is awesome ;0
nice football for practicing skills but for long range shots long passes free kick it doesnt work its worth for money;0
the ball is very good if we compare it with its price and the ball is really good i liked it but the packing was also ok;0
this ball is very bouncing its very hard its dangerous for childers under 10 years its very powerful if you play this without shoes it might broke your leg this ball has a nice design and its made of rubber this ball is tubeless when i brought it i thought it was a tube ball and we played with the ball and after 3 months on the ground i shoot it very hard and it hited a rock then the next day the balls air was gone but it was not going fast then i bought after colour of this ball;0
nice football is very fabulous colour and print is unexpected what a fabulous ball i cant say you but football came without pin and air but nice;0
this football has a great quality but its kinda too heavyhard i recommend not to fill the full airbecause it could cause injuries if it hits in our handsother than that when you touch you feel its quality and i loved this football;0
nice ball but while playing u need to look out the air in the ball is filled or notif there is no enough air inside the ballthe ball has the chance for getting hole so be carefully while playing the air is enough for playing;0
good for playing street football glad with its durability but color and logo faded just after playing a match but the product is good thanx flipkart for delivering right time ;0
a good ball for light play and fun can be used on any surface grass tarmac tiles etc is made of moulded rubber without bladder a bit hard but has good weight and bounce bought on big billion sale for 250 totally worth the price paid;0
hello guys this is an amazing product it was delivered early and good packing from flipkart and the quality of the football is good but little hard to kick it is good for playing in hard surface and highest recommended football ;0
bought it as a gift for children in society with faith that product will be tested according to standard procedure of flipkart but ball was puncture and it hardly holds air for 1 hour i felt bad for children coz they were too excited to play with it but all didnt went well coz of negligence of sellers dear sir i and many like me have developed belief on ur services coz of ur past service satandard hope your team will do the needful to maintain our belief;0
looks pretty nice but the design comes off within a week it bounces quite good i personally recommend this ball for people who just love football and do not care about the design;0
i like the ballgood ball but you can also provide the pin to pump air in it but overall its excellent product value for money thank you flipkart;0
very good ball at this price rubber moulded also but a little hard nice ball for this price and satisfied;0
good i bought 3footballs 1nivia storm2nivia storm revolution all are good but the only thing is i dont like when the football is bumped its sounds like the ball goes punchured anyway the football is very good you play any kind of surface;0
its suitable for hard grounds and street football ball has a nice pattern on it but it doesnt feel like nike or adidas while playingif you want to buy a budget football and for day to day use in streets this is the perfect match ;0
nice ball but the reason behind 4 stars is that when you bounce this ball on concrete surface it sounds like basketball but its feel nice to play with this ball;0
its okay i thinkbut no use after you hit it somewhere sharp and get a hole in itthe bladder cant be removed or repairedbut overall to use it in playgrounds its cheaper and best product that all can afford it will last long too;0
its good football go for it not for pro but good for casual play and childrens tough material in superb yellow colour and air stays for longer time once filled cant use as regular volleyball as the material is good n tough;0
its just great never thought of it a bit bouncy but still manageable really good on hard and dry condition once again thanks for the super fast delivery ;0
it is a good football i enjoyed to play with this football its quite heavy but good for those who are beginners ;0
it kinda looks good in this pic but it really isnt that good in reality i like the ball perfect for hard ground since it has a rubber coating on the top i know some people dont like it in some of these reviews but i have no problem having that coating;0
as usual the product was delivered before time and was packed nicely ive tested the ball few a times and no bad effect is been noticedthough the sound when the ball hits the ground is different but it is a good product as its stitch wont open because of its good finishingits a nice product at such a low cost thanks flipkart;0
i am playing with nivia storm from 2 monthsit is best for dribbling but it is not good for shoot it is somewhat heavy but although it swingsi am happy that i have itouter covering is is rubber moulded and it is really hardit is worst for small children but if you are a good football player then you should go for itsome bad sound comes while shooting upward in air but it is okay;0
it is a great product and nice qualitythe print disappears after 3 months but its okay very good product buy it;0
nice ball at this rate best football under 500play well in any conditionproblem is its little heavy and hard but its ok nice football for above 14 agesfastest delivery than i expected thank u flipkart;0
very nice product but very hard those who are strong they can play with this ball i highly recommend people to buy this product but those who are strong;0
got this product at rs 236 from flipkart good for normal playing colour same as shown in photo good delivery before delivery date ball is rubber molded so there is no option if bladder gets any puncture cant expect better at this price range though its written nivia but it is not original nivia product lastly good delivery service from flipkart;0
a fantastic product with a low price i love it but i got it without the needle to pump air in it it is very hard and bouncy and not very suitable for small children and only good for teenagers;0
recieved product a day before expected delivery looks in good conditon properly packaged update just got the ball pumped up looks solid but a tad less bouncy even fully pumped up good enpugh for the price though;0
loved the bounce but the skin is not that good not suitable on hard grounds the weight and bounce is really good ;0
good product and speedy delivery it is slightly disappointed to mention herein that the pin which is used to fill air was not available in the packet and i had to roam around the city for it it cost only rs 5 it would be bettr to include the same with ball as other brands do;0
feeling comfort a good product suitable for playing inside house or on good floor not suitable for playing in harsh ground but can use on good ground not has many covering over bladder but has a rubber coating strong enough to play;0
its very horrible ball but when we get it first it is awesome after some days it becomes dull and its decoration will disappear it didnt have bladder also this is true i buy this ball so i says this this is like a basket ball when we play with this we feel like we are playing with basketball we didnt feel like football it is so hard but it is nice to play its very bad ball i am saying true i buy this ball so i says this pls no one pls dont buy this ball pls i am not saying f;0
great service by flipkart considering the price point the ball is absolutely amazing yep its a bit heavy but it is a great one to buy at this price rather it is the best football at this price;0
quality is good but rubber is hitting and will hurt but the ball is good and the ball is cheap and best wear shoes and play with this ball then it is good but for barefoot it is not good buy it very good product for its rate;0
good football that doesnt come with a inflation pin had to purchase it separately it doesnt come in a box as shown in the pictures it is a bit hard when playing without studs but overall very good ball it was my brothers birthday gift if he is happy im happy ;0
the ball was of good enough quality for this price but didnt received the proper box of nivia as shown;0
this ball is rubber moulded if you want a ball which will last long then it is perfect but if you want the ball to feel nice and good when you kick then go for other balls;0
the ball is very good it is a bit hard but useful to play even basketball alsoplzzz buy this for age group of 1320 yearsplzz buydont believe other reviews plzzzeven i had a fear that it is good or notbut it is one of the best ball everplzzz buy this;0
its a good investment but incase you want a softer rubberised touch go for a cosco no 5 football but even this is good for training;0
great football at such a low price its a very good ball but print is all gone after playing out for a month overall great buy;0
this football is ideal for learners and as well for players as it gives good bounce to you but this football is made with some rubber so we should play with shoes or else this will hurt you this football can be played on grass as it moves and gives smooth first touches and if played on hard surfaces it will bounce alot and it maybe not good for the playersoverall this football is worthy to play;0
just as shown in pic looks like its tough quality and durable but u will have to pump it when it comes and then go on;0
i played with this ball in road grass wet gorund and it passed without any problem the ball is rubber moulded so have no stich and thus not get any tear on body which is good feat for this range talking about the looks well it doesnt look so good like in the photo given here but still good product go for it ;0
this ball is great but i think nivia trainer is much betterit is cheaper in snapdealthe ball has good grip and is good for matches;0
good but hard and bouncy as well;0
super but it will be dirty fast because of white color;0
good but hard too and bouncy as well;0
nice ballbut the ball is little bit hard quality is good in this price thanks flipkart;0
product is goodthe size is also perfectbut we cant play this ball with rough placeit is bust for this price;0
decent quality product bt outer rubber is harder slightly have some pain;0
it has no bladder inside so any small hole can get it easily puncturedit got punctured the day i bought it but the service of flipkart was good they replaced it immediately;0
i am giving 4 starts bcoz the is harder than i thought but it is good for all kind of groundsand some stratches r coming on it just after playing from 2 weeks;0
this product is really good;0
good but costly it came without air pumped;0
its okaybut for increasing its life span u have to spend extra 10 rupaye on fevicolthe image i uploaded is after 2 month of playingand the condition is still good;0
colour completely washout within two days;0
ball is good and light weight but if the ball is punctured then many problems arise in sewing;0
it is very light it is now dirty but nothing ris ok;0
nice ;0
good for this price but hard for childrence;0
it is nice product but it has no pin;0
yes actually the quality is good you can go for it without any doubt;0
good product good quality all are good but font play without barefootsbecause it is a hardground football;0
i give it 5star coz it deserve it;0
very good ball at this price but little hard but go for it 300 is the best price;0
the football is made from rubbered and its true that it could be punctured easily actually if u push the pin inside the football with force then only it could get punctured but at all its good according to its price its a more basketball than that type of football i suggest you to buy only for a basketball purpose not for football;0
searching for my daughter for long tym finally got on flipkart nice product n received on tym thank u flipkartn ekart both;0
delivery was within the given date which is good and football looks very awesome and strong but have to wait and watch the quality;0

it is some rough ball it is good but we play for many time it will be came soft good ball;0

bed product;0
good quality but i thought 5 size would be more big but its notrecommended for beginnersball length and width when air filled20cmit has a rough surface which makes easy to play ;0
just ok;0
quality is good but air is not filling air comes out;0
best football for beginners its a little harder than normal footballs but by the time it gets normal it is very durable using it from 9 years;0
thanku;0

this football is very good low cost but material good tri this one;0
nice products but delivery was very poor due to irrespective;0
this football is good but there is an issue that is when i inject air into it its rubber cover have some cracks;0
the material is just decent but the product is good delivery experience is amazing ;0
actually im impressed about this football at this much less price i just wanted to give it a try but it feels good while playing but its inner bladder material is very hard like a basketball and its molding is not perfect like 95 ok but its small stitching are lightly visible so i would recommend for training at home not preferable for matches especially streets and hardgrounds its outer material is fully synthetic rubber hence provides better grip on both legs and hands;0
rubber quality is not very good but also a good product;0
good but dont go for it;0
it burst in a week;0
supper dupper hit brother;0

good in performance but cooling is not sufficient for top level gaming and also mentioned as quad core but cpu is an hexa core;0
product quality good but hight does not fit the thumb properly;0
overall nice product but the packaging was very bad they have putted 2 pair in one pouch;0

good product but packaging is not upto satisfactory;0
okkkkkkkk;0
all is good but battery performance is very poor;0
an complete all rounder but the battery backup is a little less;0
battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop;0
laptop is good but delivery delay ;0
working smoothly only problem is there with battery ;0
battery performance is only 3 hours;0
average;0
absolute beast gta runs smooth csgo easily 200fps on high settings and anything above 144fps is gooddisplay is good speakers are good the battery is poor you have to plug it in while gaming or put it on 60hz and battery saver to do casual work without charger boot time too damn quickonly thing that i felt bad was the delivery guy was not trained enough he was asking me to give the otp even without checking then i reminded him this is open box delivery he says why do you buy f;0
expect battery everything was incrediblebattery be like i can only give backup for 130 hours with battery saving mode;0
this is the gaming laptop ;0
i am using this laptop for a month parformance waise is good gaming is very smooth but i face some buzz sound problem;0
performance is awesome but battery backup is low;0
its ok;0
product is good but flipkart delivery time taken was too worst;0
laptop is awesome but the battery performance is not good and have lightly heating issue;0

this order is placed yesterday evening so didnt use it much but the designing is awesome but the service is not so good by the flipkart delivery boy;0
this is my laptop laptop is premiumonly battery problem but charger is very fast;0
ok;0
all the performance is best but in game it show blue display error;0
laptop is goodif your primary focus is gaming only then buy this laptopdont expect you can rome around with this laptop thinking you will use it on battery;0
ok;0
the performance was good no complaints about it the only con is the poor battery life the laptop barely sustained for 3hrs with normal usage from being 100 charge i hope these issue might gets fixed in the future;0
great performance and a real value for money pproduct if you want a gaming beast under 60k then you should consider this i am satisfied with this purchase but just want to know about its services because i heard msi have bad service quality after purchase just one sugesstion dont use google chrome because it will impact your gaming experience i know you all will think what am saying but in my case suddenly chrome started using high cpu and using cpu full potentiol and then games start lagging;0
best laptop but only problem is battery backup;0
avg;0
1 this laptop have 40 watt gpu but still give performance similar to 60 watt of same varient 2 battery backup is somewhat around 4 hrs depend upon work 3 heat yes it heat while playing heavy game but manageable i feel heat on keyboard but bearable but i recommend cooling pad;0
performance i goodbut battery backup is not good;0
only battery was terrible overall beast in this price range;0
battery performing less 45 min on gaming;0
a bit of heating issues at the ultra setting and also lower setting rtx is just superb battery not much good over all its good and with for money;0

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t;0

all ok;0
price worth 18 watts fast charger with this price cable long enough but disappointed flipkart packaging box was opened like used one;0
charger is awesome but cable isnt good;0
it was not charging fast;0
charging is good but the build quality is poor;0
very first charging a50;0
no objections with the product but about the cost its expensive;0
looks sturdy but a little pricey;0
its compatible with pixel 6a;0
so so far quality;0

this is a good product i selected this since it is having metal arm but the problem is arm is not long as i expected and cannot withstand to the weight of samsung a20s cannot hold that weight but for my iphone 6s it is suitably fittinghope this review helps someone;0
nc;0
its size is too small than i expected overall good product because it helps alot i had purchased this kind of mobile holder 4 years ago and it was too good its size was also big but i forgot its companys name so i had to buy this adzoy stand;0
its not that powerfull to stand straightand as shown in the picture its not that long to round it up and and make a position well it can be verticaly placed as though it wont fall in my opinion never think of the poses shown can be done by that in real well it may can be if your phone is very slim and weight less;0
nice product but price is high;0
not bad;0
nice but this is short it need to little bit long;0
just ok;0
product quality is good but it should be give angle for adjustable for any situationthis is best only for desk or table uses when you are sitting on chair which height is higher than table or desk then you can easily work with thisfor other situations its just okhardly use to plug in charging cablethere is small space for thisyou have to use your phone in landscape mode when you are charging your phone otherwise your data cable can be damage you can see in the picturesfor example;0
product is good as i use iphone 7 and one plus 6tno issue with productbut courier was delayed and they were not fulfilled the dates they mentioned of deliver3 times postponed the datesapart from that product is fine;0
product is good but price is higher than the item but delivery awesome;0
good for mobile not a tab;0
very useful but overpriced should be of rs 150 to 200;0
usefull;0
product is good but quality something cheap ;0
its a just average product;0
its ok;0
rubber strip is not placed properly ;0
good quality product but it cant manage the mobiles weight properly when the mobile is kept vertically it has a tendency to fall back;0
average qualities product arenot same as image shown sample material average quality;0
just ok;0
not excellent but value for money;0
good but expensive;0
the build of the stand is metal but not too much great for tall smartphones they just fall on the back if you are thinking of using a charging cable then its not a great idea because the stand height is not that much high to take a cable from back it really bends your charging cable so summary is if you want to buy it for just mobile standing and your phone is not too long then surely you can buy this;0
not adjustable but works fine as a stand;0
good product its metal items so that it cant be up or down not foldable otherwise its ok;0
my unit is a little bit tilted;0
ok;0
ok;0
its ok and excellent product thanks;0
need base plate quality not but okay;0
ok;0
not that stable but overall good;0
product is good and useful but price is bit higher still happy after buying using the mobile standholder i recommend to buy it if one have to attend online classes or online work through mobile;0
more than what i have expected;0
the product is very good but one thing to say that the delivery boy was sick that day so he sent another boy and the boy was so idiot and rubbish and bad behaved that he was doing a bad behaviour with himmy father has an excellent personality everywhere that is why he has not told or done anything to him otherwise that day should be his last working day so product is fine but the delivery performance 0 star ;0
dont price worth but good product;0
its ok;0
the product is not bad but the price is high;0
nicefor phones but not perfect for tablets;0
ok;0
ok ok product;0
not bad;0
its good but small ok;0
in a must have accessories;0
small;0
ok for this amt;0
itvery goodso easy to assemble but stand pad should be more heavy;0
mobile holder is so tight;0
ok;0
okk okk;0
this product is quite good if you want to enjoy content like movies it is perfect for that the built quality is also goodand there is only one problem in it ie you cannot use earphone when phone is in vertical like in the photo;0
this mobile stand is made of metal looks and feels sturdy limited adjustinfolding options but then it is quite obvious in the display itself the stand has to be at a proper angle so that it the mobile does not topple no safety clip to secure the mobile in place so you have to be very careful or your precious mobile could slip of the holder and fall again it is apparent in the pics so not disappointed it could have been priced a bit lower but overall it does what its supposed to do;0
good to use sturdy but not so weight i am happy that i have done a good job;0
product quality is so goodbut little bit over priced over all fine product;0
very usefulbut price is too high rs 200 around is best for this product;0
nice and we can easily adjustable but price is too high 300 rupees;0
build quality is good but it is not suitable if you are trying to view at an upright angle because the phone will fall down from the stand they should have a holding mechanism for the phone from the top like a strap or hook or sticking mechanism to avoid the fall;0
ok;0
its very handy and lever grip us also goodit holds;0
ok ok;0
item is so so;0
material is strong enough to hold heavy smart phones doesnt get hot while charging but has one issue i e the phone rest on the edge of the product via usb attached to the phone that might can effect the usb or the connector of phone as the edge is not having a cut on the sides so that the phone doesnt hang in air from usb attached side;0
this product is not good but not bad;0

this marq oven is look good and also working properly but back side and down side of the oven giving electric shock and inside also when you will take out cake or any thing from over it will give you electric shock so i refer you dont buy this marq microphone ;0
good but take 36 ltr;0
nice product and good quality but overall very heavy heat but ok;0
just a good otg perform like a king but i cons no light were given inside the otg rest all ok;0
its good otg at this price but roasting stiks are very thin;0

i bought this in 3500 for a wedding gift and next day it was 2900 i hate u for doing this flipkart but yeah i have one in my home and it works fantastic that s why i decided to buy this as a gift;0
after using its really very good but only thing is the product body gets heated other than that excellent;0
purchased at rs 2199 very good in this price range but no light inside of this otg this is considered to be a cons;0
i bought 24 lit it has light insidebut in this model no lightperformance is good;0
honestly otg is really good but the thing is i dont bake or grillnot good for reheating food i fill this would more useful for baker so make ur choice;0
its just ok for the price but if you can spend a bit more better to try out other specialised brands its not very powerful in heating if both the filaments are on it does not even melt cheeze even if heated for 20 mins on 250 degree it heats well only if one of top or bottom filament is on heating is also very uneven but again its what u get best at this price get it only if u r really short on budget;0
it is good product targeting budget range overall decent product no problem faced till date only cons is that its volume capacity;0
its ok;0
is okay;0
amazing but 18 litre is not sufficient for 45 people;0
king off kichian;0
good productbut price increased;0
i purchase at 2800;0
looking good but i dont prefer 1200 watt heating is slow take so much time bake pizza;0
used less but so far so goodneed to try more by utilising this lock down period;0
good but work slowly;0
product is very good but the description says there is cabin light but in actual there is no cabin light overall sastified with the product;0
havent used yet but all seem to be fine timely delivered ;0
ok;0
good but smlk in size;0
demo and installation;0
nice but my opinion was he was give any guidance on how to cook in otg oven booklet which type of bowl is it possible to use;0
just average;0
very good product but not installed what can i do delivered 16112020 stil now not installed today 21112020 i dont knowat that its self install your executive call me and replayed me that case so i am very glad to know and your executive replayed very helpful i am very hapy;0
working good;0
was good but shd hve given more abt tht if set n keep becomes to much roast;0
every thing is okbut no bill in it;0
very shocking worst product everywhere the surface is heat my hand s one of the finger is slightly burn but product is good ;0
product goodbut delayed delivery;0
ha good serves the purpose but it is too lite as of a box overall good ;0
prosprice is lessquality is goodpacking also goodconsbaking is not good compared to pressure cooker cake sometimes not bake every side up and downno fan;0
ok;0
i was expecting something solid but it is very fragile on the top and from the sides;0
just ok;0
excellent product but pure made in china no isi mark ;0
nice but for grilling a full chicken it takes 1 hour heated in 250;0
ok;0
its worth for the price but not sure on the heating modes for me its working only with toasted mode other modes not sufficient i believe;0
the otg looks good with basic functionalities it doesnt have a cook book for the first timers it becomes difficult to assess the time taken to cook a food the instruction manual is basic the food cooks well in this;0
i would say it is a rough and tuff product to use but everything gets very got except handle and knobs;0
though product is excellentbut at least demo should be providedsee a bad reputation builds thereoverall learned hw to use this via pamphlet and videos online and the seller and flipkart should consider on this providing assistance for some products which do not have technical assistance;0
body of otg so hot when we oprate it;0
very giftedexicellent;0
average product;0
wonderful ;0
marq otg is best but delivery is so late;0
nice oven but not gaining temperature properly;0
ok;0
hot oven;0
nice product but information leaflet and recipe book is missing;0
ok;0
gudbut light is not inside;0
worthy for money i like it but power cable is very small;0
guidance can be given more intensivelybut its a outstanding product;0
good product at this pricebut the should provide basis moulds for baking;0
decent;0
its make a tasty roast ;0
the product is good but i i dont know how to attach the skewers and no one came to install this otg oven;0
i tried chicken pieces for first time in oven and its cooked well;0
product is good but no demo no link for guidance;0
ok;0
the product is gud value for money only thing is it became hot which is obvious but i also got electric shock 2wice i dont know y ;0
grate product;0
we can not reset the time otherwise its good;0
ism product;0
everything is nice but power cord is too short;0
very light weight;0
i am using it for 2 weeks upto now itz perfectthe user manual can have more details;0
superb but re heating iis not possible;0
lovely product does the job well initially was afriad too but it however now completely satisfiedwas a birthday gift too my mom;0
till now product is working well its approx a week or so i purchased it good according to its prize only con i can see is it doesnt have inbuilt fan which would help distribute heat all over the oven other wise cooked things r yummyier than before cheese spreads and melts very evenlyif u have low budget can definitely go with this without a doubt bt if u r a professional or u have used some other otg before then it would be not a good choicethis oven is especially for beginners ;0
superb products but delivery value for no money delayed delivery may be due to bbd pics speak better than wordsdominos pizza failed in front of self curated pizza with loads of lovethanks marq by flipkart;0
if budget allows buy something branded than this;0
according to the price it is worth but buy a better productits weight is approximately 1 or two k g ;0
i thought otg is better than oven for various cooking methods but there is delay in cooking time overall it is a good product;0
ok;0
good otg oven but missing convection fan and rotisserie function;0
very good with performance but before some days inbuilt light has been off i purchased this 4th of may 2022;0
havent used the item but can rate according to look ;0
just ok;0
not bad not good;0
good product at reasonable price first i got defective product but flipkart replace d it;0
thankyou;0

not bad but so light and thin body;0
the product is really good but the body gets really hot as mentioned on the product it cools down as fast it gets hot;0
ok;0
as good as other leading brandsvery light weight but does the job have used it in past three months for cakes and chicken grill;0
superb but otg also over heating;0

recently purchased the above router which seems to be good having a wide range delivery of flipkert is also good but the lan cable supplied with the router is very very short and thus it is very difficult to keep the router above the table specially those who are using desktop computers the manufacturer should look in to this matter and arrange to supply a more lengthy minimu 5 long cable otherwise customer has to purchase another cable;0
wifi connection and speed is very good but range is pathetic 5 gz channel it is may be 10 feet in the house which was expected but on 24 channel itvis almost the same my 5 years old belkin router range is much much better than this not suitable for long distance;0

after buying this for 21500 i saw reviews on youtube about it an came across video where they said installation time was huge after getting the tv also you cant open it as it voids warranty which made me think twice on the purchase made but flipkart lived up to the expectation the tv was delivered in morning and installed by afternoon same day cons tv doesnt have amazon prime video or netflixs or jio cinema possibly you can side load them not tried that yetbrightness is weired;0
nice tv if you are on a tight budget but dont expect picture quality like high end or even mid range sony tvs internet connectivity is good you can enjoy youtube but netflix and prime video doesnt work as if now so you have to keep this thing in mind;0

price is a bit high when compared to other streaming devices but over all a good deal if u want pure android experience and also u can sideload apps of ur choice without any issue which cannot be done in firestick and smart tv boxes of other companiesmoreover the this is having a good ram capacity ie 2gb while other brands only provide 1gb;0
this is bought after watching many reviews on youtube where they say this is a very mediocre product they might be right in that buti have read many reviews on fk as well some said its a good product some said its notmy review about it doesnt has the heating issue it might coz many are using it with a wall mount tv which would be sticked very closely to the wall so to avoid it use a extension hdmi cable approx rs 150 my advice is to order it along while ordering mi stickn;0
i was a big fan of fire tv stick as i have used it for 15 months with all good but their after sales service has made me change my mind ultimately i have to buy new one so i have decided to look for android stick considering its potential of downloading app but thats not true at all what android os advertising i mean whats a point if you do not have chrome browser in os coming back to mi stick i have choose it after lot of research have been done on the availability in the market i w;0
must build quality;0
i am using it on my 24 sony bravia led tv till now the only problem i faced is the fact that as my tv is wall mounted the device was not going inside the hdmi port easily and as a result it was not being detected by the tv next day i got one male to male hdmi extension cable and one female to female hdmi adapter and after that once the connections were made i could use the device without an issue till date one more thing about it is though that its power cord is really short around 1mtr;0
very useful working just fine so far had heating issue but using hdmi extension cable to resolved heating issue;0
good product but it is lagging at times;0
the product is presently working fine setup is little difficult thereafter it is fine works according to your wifi speed but if the ram is 16 gb it will be a great deal lack a usb port and slightly heating i will update my review after a month;0
small compactible devicei liked;0
its more than expected;0
goog product but heating issue;0
i made a review and unboxing video to check it search shankarling kadganchi in youtube and watch the video;0
when i use first day its was soo irritated me after restart it was working very well casting was some little lagging but okay im satisfied with this product;0
hdmi cable is not available with this productit cannot directly plugin to some of the tvs in which hdmi port is in a pocket for my vu tv it is not possible to connect directlyi ordered a hdmi cable after purchase;0
very good product but it has some lag issues so please fix it overall very good one ;0
hello everyonethere is no return policy on this product please do check and purchase and ever customer care is not good at assisting please do check tv hdmi slots and tv frameweather it would fit or not ;0
the device will not work for the onida brand the device is not listing onida in tv brands while setting up even though you force setup volume controls will not work so check the compatible tv brand before buyinginorder to make this device work with your unlisted tv brand complete the setup by selecting any tv brand after completing setup go to settings and select remote and accessories menu in that delete the tv brand you selected and set volume controls shutdown controls to chrome;0
is a decent purchase only for non smart tvs for smart tvs its utter waste as most of the indian streaming services dont support it and the ones that do are already available in the tv software for smart tvs would suggest firestick owing to a separate remote that offers voice search across apps;0
a great product but it is difficult for the elderly to understand its operation also it takes really long to connect to wifi other than that works well overall and must thank flipkart for great packaging and delivering the product in a great condition;0
the product is so good that i have no words it has made my stupid lcd tv a smart tv you can not cast everything from apple products its very smalll it requires power from usb port continuously during its run and it has no battery it has a small light which confirms if it is powered or not and secondly same light converts into white which shows its connected once tv is on and if its the only thing connected in hdmi then it will automatically start google home you need to download goo;0
it gives 6 months gaana subscription and 1 year sony liv subscription free easy setup good streaming the only thing that bugs me is that i found it a bit slow with fast internet connection streaming devices can be faster and they should beupdate chromecast is compatible with mx player good so it can cast downloaded movies directly to your tv very good but still i would like to give it just 1 star reason being chromecast does not support major video formats this is seriously un;0
product is good if you are going to buy it for smart tv or any device which has inbuilt speakers and hdmi portbut if you are buy it for monitor then i am going to say dont buy this because when you connect it to monitor you cant listen the sound and there but screen mirroring can be doneyour wifi network speed should be good for castingmirroring atleast 1315 megabits if you dont have wifi router or broadband then dont buy it because without this you need two phones everytime to;0

chrome cast3 works wonders i had an lg oled panel tv from 2014 which apparently was not smart even though it costed us a whopping 62000 long story short i was considering apple tv4k and chrome cast 3 bought both of them but chrome cast 3 is practical and is very useful small and doesnt need an external power supply every possible ios app that you need to watch your stuff is supported netflix hbo max prime video jiotv hot star hulu and for anime weebs yes it does support ;0
good product i loved it but in mobile no internet within a hour it cleaned 15 gb databut quality is i liked ;0
this device sets up so easily that it suits the title plug in n play it needs an external power supply so adds a wire to it but its really worth it also it heats up at times but not alarmingly latching on to the wifi is super smooth all you need to do is download google homechromecast and youre good to go ;0
good product for google lovers this device only for media streaming the quality of video is medium i connected to fhd screen but the video quality is 480p so those who consider googles convenience go for itthose who want fhd 4k and other good features go for another media streaming boxesone more thing the screen mirroring of phone or laptop is possible only via googlehome app or google chromes cast optionwe can not use this for live data transfer as alternative of hdmi c;0

ive been using this product since past 3 months and totally enjoying itits the most hassle free device to cast and screen your phone almost all the apps are possible to be casted from your phone and only a few apps which are very specific or not popular need to be mirrored to be watched on screeni personally find it better than fire stick as many people think fire stick is better due to non dependency on phonebut let me tell you nowadays youve everything on your phone only an;0
it looks like google has applied soffisticated softwares just to allow the viewers to watch its own youtube and a few non free channels it has tied up with a number of chromecastable free apps are available in play store but none of them works even vlc player has chrome cast support but this product just gives an empty screen on tv;0
works as expected works out of the box and delivered within 36 hours although relatively old model in chromecast lineup but it is a brand new piece and a great option against the much expensive chromecast ultraekart delivery was great as well no nonsense direct call on the gate to ensure hassle free contactless delivery in times of pandemic just like competition;0
it works perfectly fine with most apps that has the casting capability but the screen mirroring doesnt work consistently;0
if you dont have stock android then it needs 2 smartphones to connect one to share hotspot one to perform tasks i dont like below things1 why there is need of 2 smartphones to connect although hotspot sharing and task performing both can be done only with one2 why there is a need of internet always to connect firstly i thought it would need only at first time to connect but it need same everytimeotherwise i got everything i want smooth screen mirroring casting and yes su;0

it seems to be small than the given image but does the work effeciently;0
dont buy this if you have not wifi router;0
device get heat up in few minutes i know it is going to happen but within 15 minutes is too way shorter period because of wireless transmission it heats up to keep it connected with tv requires certain risk as in most of tv it would almost stay behind the screen touching the back panel of screen ;0
it needs lots of internet with min 2mbps required for all streaming;0
its best for media streamingbut not suitable for connecting pc to bigger display because of delay;0
awesome working but few things below we need wifi router to work freely if u dont have wifi router then u need 2 mobiles 1 for hot spot and 1 for wifi for online streaming it is working without any problem but mirror cast struck after 30 mins or 1 hour audio not coming then again we need to disconnect and mirror cast again;0

this item is very bad dont buying ;-1
i recommend that the ball quality was very cheap the ball price also very high i didnt satisfy with the ball i recommend that no one will buy this ball;-1
the football is not at all worth the prize it is made up of cheap rubber material and inside there is no bladder so you can imagine the quality with one strong kick its gone that what happened when my son played the very first day he received the footballjust one big kick and all the air came out pathetic i would not recommend this football to any kid beginners or senior player the rubber is not capable of taking any kind of impact;-1
ball is nice very good but the warrantee of ball is not at all good having cuts and my both 2 ball are puntered pls dont buy if ur buying only 1 plsss;-1
i dont think it as a good idea buying this ball online because while playing we didnt feel like playing football moreover like basketball the manufacturing is same as that of basketball it is real hard which makes it lasting in hard grounds but i dont like this ball;-1
i am surprised bordering on shock for the positive feedback on this ball i have several balls in my possession from reputable brands like nike reebok and cosco this particular product from nivia is a dud the ball is a molded rubber ball with a hard material it is not easy on the legs i purchased this ball from ebay spend a couple of hundreds more and go for a different model in nivia nivia shinning star is good product or reebok valde dont waste money on nivia storm it is no good;-1
its not a good one just a rubber moulded one not recommended guys i m going to buy a new one from local store because we need to check these kind of items physically before buy look and colour not helpful to choose the right one;-1
if u r looking for a normal football then this one is not a good option good quality and tough material;-1
good delivery timing communication with you guys very good but product which shows not like that may it will be more than that thank you improve that;-1
its heavier and tougher than other footballs that will hurt your legs due to rubber moulded its hard and same as a basketball of size 5 playing with it is like playing with basketball its not good for matches nd can only be used while training other things are quite well its more durable and if u get habit of playing with it youll have no probs ;-1
useless it got puncture in first day ball is very hard but not good for hard ground please go for ball of cost 600;-1
rubber moulding will hurt on legs if you dont play with shoes a bit more bouncy ball and this line because the review needed min 100 characters;-1
i bought this ball 2 days ago and was shocked because it was so hardin the description at flipkart it was written it is softim telling you dont buy its a ball with a rubber outer shellsame as basketball so practically you are just kicking a basketball around which only has the size of a footballdont buy;-1
